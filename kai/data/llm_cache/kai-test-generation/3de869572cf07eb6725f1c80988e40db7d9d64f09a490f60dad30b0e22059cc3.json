This is because the `javax.annotation` package is part of the Java EE API, which has been migrated to the Jakarta EE namespace. \n\nThe `@PostConstruct`, `@Resource`, and `@Singleton` annotations are part of the `javax.annotation` package, so we need to update the import statements to use the `jakarta.annotation` package instead.\n\nHere are the steps to update the code:\n\n1. Replace the `javax.annotation` import statement with `jakarta.annotation`.\n2. Update the import statements for `@PostConstruct`, `@Resource`, and `@Singleton` to use the `jakarta.annotation` package.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.utils;\n\nimport org.flywaydb.core.Flyway;\nimport org.flywaydb.core.api.FlywayException;\n\nimport jakarta.annotation.PostConstruct;\nimport jakarta.annotation.Resource;\nimport jakarta.ejb.Singleton;\nimport jakarta.ejb.Startup;\nimport jakarta.ejb.TransactionManagement;\nimport jakarta.ejb.TransactionManagementType;\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\nimport jakarta.sql.DataSource;\nimport java.util.logging.Level;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\n/**\n * Created by tqvarnst on 2017-04-04.\n */\n@Singleton\n@Startup\n@TransactionManagement(TransactionManagementType.BEAN)\npublic class DataBaseMigrationStartup {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger logger;\n\n    @Resource(mappedName = \"java:jboss/datasources/CoolstoreDS\")\n    DataSource dataSource;\n\n    @PostConstruct\n    private void startup() {\n\n\n        try {\n            logger.info(\"Initializing/migrating the database using FlyWay\");\n            Flyway flyway = new Flyway();\n            flyway.setDataSource(dataSource);\n            flyway.baseline();\n            // Start the db.migration\n            flyway.migrate();\n        } catch (FlywayException e) {\n            if(logger !=null)\n                logger.log(Level.SEVERE,\"FAILED TO INITIALIZE THE DATABASE: \" + e.getMessage(),e);\n            else\n                System.out.println(\"FAILED TO INITIALIZE THE DATABASE: \" + e.getMessage() + \" and injection of logger doesn't work\");\n\n        }\n    }\n\n\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nNote that this change may require updates to the project's dependencies in the `pom.xml` file.
