This is because Jakarta EE has replaced the `javax` namespace with `jakarta` to avoid conflicts with the Java namespace.\n\nHere are the steps to fix the issue:\n\n1. Identify the import statement that needs to be replaced: `import javax.enterprise.context.Dependent;` and `import javax.enterprise.inject.Produces;`\n2. Replace the `javax.enterprise` namespace with `jakarta.enterprise` in the import statements.\n3. Update the import statements to `import jakarta.enterprise.context.Dependent;` and `import jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces;`\n\nNo changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this specific issue, but it's worth noting that when migrating to Jakarta EE, the `pom.xml` file may need to be updated to use the Jakarta EE APIs and dependencies.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.persistence;\n\nimport jakarta.enterprise.context.Dependent;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces;\nimport javax.persistence.EntityManager;\nimport javax.persistence.PersistenceContext;\n\n@Dependent\npublic class Resources {\n\n    @PersistenceContext\n    private EntityManager em;\n\n    @Produces\n    public EntityManager getEntityManager() {\n        return em;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nWhen migrating to Jakarta EE, it's essential to ensure that the project dependencies are updated to use the Jakarta EE APIs. This may involve updating the `pom.xml` file to use the Jakarta EE BOM (Bill of Materials) and replacing the Java EE dependencies with their Jakarta EE counterparts. However, this is not required for this specific issue.",
