      "content": "## Reasoning\nTo address the issue described in incident 0, we need to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This is because the `javax.inject` package is part of the Java EE specification, and when migrating to Jakarta EE, the package names change from `javax` to `jakarta`.\n\nHere are the steps to fix the issue:\n\n1. Identify the import statement that needs to be replaced: `import javax.inject.Inject;`\n2. Replace the import statement with the correct Jakarta EE package: `import jakarta.inject.Inject;`\n3. Verify that the `@Inject` annotation is still valid and functional after the package change.\n\nNo changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this specific issue, as we are only updating an import statement. However, when migrating to Jakarta EE, additional dependencies may need to be updated or added to the `pom.xml` file.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.utils;\n\nimport weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleEvent;\nimport weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleListener;\n\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\npublic class StartupListener extends ApplicationLifecycleListener {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n    @Override\n    public void postStart(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {\n        log.info(\"AppListener(postStart)\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void preStop(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {\n        log.info(\"AppListener(preStop)\");\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNote that this change is part of a larger migration effort from Java EE to Jakarta EE. Additional changes may be required to complete the migration, including updates to other import statements, dependencies, and potentially code changes to accommodate differences between the Java EE and Jakarta EE specifications.",
