The namespace `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` is being replaced with `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee` to reflect the change from Java EE to Jakarta EE. Additionally, the schema version number needs to be updated to match the new namespace.\n\nThe updated namespace and schema version number are required to ensure compatibility with Jakarta EE. The change from `http` to `https` in the namespace URL is also a good practice to ensure secure communication.\n\nNo changes are required in the `pom.xml` file or imports for this specific update, as it only involves updating the XML namespace and schema version number in the `beans.xml` file.\n\n## Updated xml File\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!--\n    JBoss, Home of Professional Open Source\n    Copyright 2015, Red Hat, Inc. and/or its affiliates, and individual\n    contributors by the @authors tag.
