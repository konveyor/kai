This change is required because Jakarta EE 9 and later versions use the `jakarta.persistence` package instead of `javax.persistence`.\n\nHere are the steps to update the code:\n\n1. Replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence`.\n2. Update the `EntityManager` and `PersistenceContext` annotations to use the `jakarta.persistence` package.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.persistence;\n\nimport jakarta.enterprise.context.Dependent;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces;\nimport jakarta.persistence.EntityManager;\nimport jakarta.persistence.PersistenceContext;\n\n@Dependent\npublic class Resources {\n\n    @PersistenceContext\n    private EntityManager em;\n\n    @Produces\n    public EntityManager getEntityManager() {\n        return em;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nWhen updating the import statements, make sure to update the `pom.xml` file to use the correct Jakarta EE dependencies. The `javax.persistence` dependency should be replaced with the `jakarta.persistence` dependency.\n\nFor example, if you are using Maven, you can update the `pom.xml` file as follows:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>jakarta.persistence</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jakarta.persistence-api</artifactId>\n    <version>3.0.0</version>\n</dependency>\n```\nNote: The exact version of the `jakarta.persistence-api` dependency may vary depending on your project requirements.",
