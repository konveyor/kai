      "content": "## Reasoning\nTo address the issue described in incident 0, we need to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This is because the `javax.inject` package is part of the Java EE specification, and we are migrating to Jakarta EE, which has a different package namespace.\n\nHere are the steps to fix the issue:\n\n1. Identify the import statement that needs to be replaced: `import javax.inject.Inject;`\n2. Replace the import statement with the correct Jakarta EE package: `import jakarta.inject.Inject;`\n3. Verify that the `@Inject` annotation is still valid and functional after the import statement change.\n\nNo changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this specific issue, as we are only updating an import statement. However, it's worth noting that when migrating to Jakarta EE, you may need to update your dependencies to use the Jakarta EE APIs instead of the Java EE APIs.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.utils;\n\nimport weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleEvent;\nimport weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleListener;\n\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\npublic class StartupListener extends ApplicationLifecycleListener {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n    @Override\n    public void postStart(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {\n        log.info(\"AppListener(postStart)\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void preStop(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {\n        log.info(\"AppListener(preStop)\");\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nWhen migrating to Jakarta EE, you may need to update your dependencies to use the Jakarta EE APIs instead of the Java EE APIs. For example, you may need to replace `javax.inject` with `jakarta.inject` in your `pom.xml` file. Additionally, you may need to update your application server to support Jakarta EE.",
