      "content": "## Reasoning\n\nTo address the issue of session replication in a cloud environment, we need to disable HTTP session clustering. This is because session replication relies on the application server's ability to share session information between nodes, which may not be reliable in a cloud environment where containers can be restarted at any time.\n\nIn Quarkus, we can use the `@Singleton` annotation to create a singleton bean that will store the session data. This way, we can avoid relying on the application server's session replication mechanism.\n\nWe will also need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the necessary dependencies for Quarkus and the `@Singleton` annotation.\n\nHere are the steps we will take:\n\n1. Remove the `distributable` element from the `web.xml` file, as it is not needed in Quarkus.\n2. Update the `pom.xml` file to include the Quarkus dependencies.\n3. Update the `pom.xml` file to include the `@Singleton` annotation dependency.\n4. Update the Java class that uses the session to use the `@Singleton` annotation.\n\n## Updated File\n\n```xml\n<!--suppress ServletWithoutMappingInspection -->\n<web-app xmlns=\"http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n         xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd\"\n         version=\"3.0\">\n    <!-- Removed distributable element -->\n</web-app>\n```\n\n```xml\n<!-- pom.xml -->\n<dependencies>\n    <!-- Quarkus dependencies -->\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n        <artifactId>quarkus-core</artifactId>\n    </dependency>\n    <!-- @Singleton annotation dependency -->\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>javax.enterprise</groupId>\n        <artifactId>cdi-api</artifactId>\n    </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\n\n```java\n// Updated Java class\nimport javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;\nimport javax.inject.Singleton;\n\n@Singleton\npublic class SessionManager {\n    // Session management logic\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\n\nNote that we have removed the `distributable` element from the `web.xml` file, as it is not needed in Quarkus. We have also updated the `pom.xml` file to include the Quarkus dependencies and the `@Singleton` annotation dependency.\n\nIn the updated Java class, we have used the `@Singleton` annotation to create a singleton bean that will store the session data. This way, we can avoid relying on the application server's session replication mechanism.\n\nIt's worth noting that we may need to update the Java class to use the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation instead of `@Singleton` if we want to use a different scope for the session manager. However, this will depend on the specific requirements of the application.",
