In Quarkus, we can achieve this by removing the `distributable` element from the `web.xml` file.\n\nHowever, since we are migrating to Quarkus, we should also consider removing the `web.xml` file altogether, as Quarkus uses annotations to configure the application. \n\nWe will also need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the necessary dependencies for Quarkus.\n\n## Updated File\n```xml\n<!-- web.xml should be removed in a Quarkus application -->\n<!-- \nweb.xml should be removed in a Quarkus application\n-->\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nTo complete the migration, we will need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the following dependencies:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n    <artifactId>quarkus-undertow</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n    <artifactId>quarkus-jdbc-mysql</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```\nWe will also need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the Quarkus BOM (Bill of Materials):\n```xml\n<dependencyManagement>\n    <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n            <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n            <artifactId>quarkus-bom</artifactId>\n            <version>2.14.2.Final</version>\n            <type>pom</type>\n            <scope>import</scope>\n        </dependency>\n    </dependencies>\n</dependencyManagement>\n```\nWe will also need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the necessary plugins for Quarkus:\n```xml\n<build>\n    <plugins>\n        <plugin>\n            <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n            <artifactId>quarkus-maven-plugin</artifactId>\n            <version>2.14.2.Final</version>\n            <executions>\n                <execution>\n                    <goals>\n                        <goal>build</goal>\n                    </goals>\n                </execution>\n            </executions>\n        </plugin>\n    </plugins>\n</build>\n```\nFinally, we will need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the necessary configuration for Quarkus:\n```xml\n<properties>\n    <quarkus.platform.artifact-id>quarkus-universe-bom</quarkus.platform.artifact-id>\n    <quarkus.platform.group-id>io.quarkus</quarkus.platform.group-id>\n    <quarkus.platform.version>2.14.2.Final</quarkus.platform.version>\n</properties>\n```\nNote that these are just the necessary dependencies and plugins for a basic Quarkus application.
