      "content": "## Reasoning\nThe issue at hand is related to session replication in a cloud environment. The current `web.xml` file has the `<distributable />` tag, which enables session replication. However, in a cloud environment, this can lead to issues with data loss in case of a node failure.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to disable HTTP session clustering. In Quarkus, this can be achieved by using the `@SessionScoped` annotation from the `javax.enterprise.context` package and configuring the session store to use a cache backing service or a remote data grid.\n\nHowever, since we are just taking the first step towards migrating to Quarkus, we will focus on disabling the session replication. We can do this by removing the `<distributable />` tag from the `web.xml` file.\n\nBut, since Quarkus uses a different approach for configuring the application, we can remove the `web.xml` file altogether. Quarkus uses annotations and configuration properties to configure the application.\n\n## Updated File\n```xml\n<!-- This file can be removed as Quarkus uses a different approach for configuring the application -->\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nTo completely disable HTTP session clustering in Quarkus, you would need to configure the `quarkus.http.session` properties in your `application.properties` file. For example:\n\n```properties\nquarkus.http.session.persistent=false\nquarkus.http.session.timeout=30m\n```\n\nYou would also need to add the `quarkus-undertow` dependency to your `pom.xml` file:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n    <artifactId>quarkus-undertow</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nHowever, these changes are not part of this step and will be addressed in subsequent steps.",
