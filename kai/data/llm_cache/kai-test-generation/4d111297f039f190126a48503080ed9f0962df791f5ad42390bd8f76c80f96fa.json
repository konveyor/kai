Since the recommendation is to disable it, we will remove the `<distributable />` element from the `web.xml` file. This element is used to enable session replication in a clustered environment.\n\nBy removing this element, we are essentially disabling session replication and accepting its implications. This change will allow the application to scale more easily and survive node failures without losing session data.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that this change might require additional modifications to the application to handle session management properly. The recommendations suggest re-architecting the application to store sessions in a cache backing service or a remote data grid.\n\nNo changes are required in the `pom.xml` file or imports for this specific modification.\n\n## Updated xml File\n```xml\n<!--suppress ServletWithoutMappingInspection -->\n<web-app xmlns=\"http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n         xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd\"\n         version=\"3.0\">\n</web-app>\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nAs mentioned earlier, disabling session replication might require additional modifications to the application to handle session management properly. It's recommended to re-architect the application to store sessions in a cache backing service or a remote data grid. This might involve using technologies like Redis, Hazelcast, or Infinispan, and would likely require changes to the application code and configuration.",
