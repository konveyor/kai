      "content": "## Reasoning\n\nTo migrate the `ShoppingCartOrderProcessor` class from Java EE to Quarkus, we need to address the issue with the `@Stateless` annotation. \n\nIn Java EE, `@Stateless` is used to define a stateless session bean, which is a type of Enterprise JavaBean (EJB). However, Quarkus does not support EJBs. Instead, we can use Context and Dependency Injection (CDI) beans, which are a standard part of Java EE and are also supported by Quarkus.\n\nTo convert the `ShoppingCartOrderProcessor` class to a CDI bean, we need to replace the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope annotation. In this case, we can use `@ApplicationScoped`, which means that the bean will be created once and shared by all users of the application.\n\nHere are the steps to update the code:\n\n1. Remove the `@Stateless` annotation from the `ShoppingCartOrderProcessor` class.\n2. Add the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation to the `ShoppingCartOrderProcessor` class.\n\nBy making these changes, we are converting the `ShoppingCartOrderProcessor` class from a stateless session bean to a CDI bean with application scope.\n\n## Updated File\n\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\nimport jakarta.annotation.Resource;\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;\nimport jakarta.jms.JMSContext;\nimport jakarta.jms.Topic;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\n@ApplicationScoped\npublic class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n\n    @Inject\n    private transient JMSContext context;\n\n    @Resource(lookup = \"java:/topic/orders\")\n    private Topic ordersTopic;\n\n    \n  \n    public void  process(ShoppingCart cart) {\n        log.info(\"Sending order from processor: \");\n        context.createProducer().send(ordersTopic, Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart));\n    }\n\n\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\n\nNote that we also need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the necessary dependencies for CDI and JMS. However, since this is not explicitly mentioned in the input information, we will assume that these dependencies are already included in the `pom.xml` file.\n\nAdditionally, we need to make sure that the `jakarta.enterprise.context` package is imported, which includes the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation.",
