This is because Jakarta EE 9 and later versions use the `jakarta` namespace instead of `javax`.\n\nHere are the steps to update the code:\n\n1. Identify the import statement that needs to be updated: `import javax.enterprise.context.Dependent;` and `import javax.enterprise.inject.Produces;`\n2. Replace `javax.enterprise` with `jakarta.enterprise` in the import statements.\n3. Verify that the updated import statements are correct and match the Jakarta EE 9 namespace.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.persistence;\n\nimport jakarta.enterprise.context.Dependent;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces;\nimport jakarta.persistence.EntityManager;\nimport jakarta.persistence.PersistenceContext;\n\n@Dependent\npublic class Resources {\n\n    @PersistenceContext\n    private EntityManager em;\n\n    @Produces\n    public EntityManager getEntityManager() {\n        return em;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nNote that this change will also require updating the `pom.xml` file to use the Jakarta EE 9 API dependencies instead of the Java EE dependencies. Specifically, the `javax.enterprise` dependencies should be replaced with `jakarta.enterprise` dependencies.\n\nFor example, if the `pom.xml` file contains the following dependency:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>javax.enterprise</groupId>\n    <artifactId>cdi-api</artifactId>\n    <version>2.0</version>\n</dependency>\n```\nIt should be updated to:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>jakarta.enterprise</groupId>\n    <artifactId>cdi-api</artifactId>\n    <version>4.0</version>\n</dependency>\n```\nSimilarly, other dependencies that use the `javax` namespace should be updated to use the `jakarta` namespace.",
