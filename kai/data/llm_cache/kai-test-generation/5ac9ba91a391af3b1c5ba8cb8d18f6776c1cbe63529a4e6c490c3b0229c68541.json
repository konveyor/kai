      "content": "## Reasoning\n\nTo address the issue described in incident 0, we need to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This is because the `javax.inject` package is part of the Java EE specification, which has been migrated to the Jakarta EE namespace.\n\nHere are the steps to fix the issue:\n\n1. Identify the import statement that needs to be replaced: `import javax.inject.Inject;`\n2. Replace the `javax.inject` package with `jakarta.inject`: `import jakarta.inject.Inject;`\n3. Verify that the `jakarta.inject` package is available in the project's classpath. This may require updating the project's dependencies in the `pom.xml` file.\n\n## Updated java File\n\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.utils;\n\nimport weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleEvent;\nimport weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleListener;\n\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\npublic class StartupListener extends ApplicationLifecycleListener {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n    @Override\n    public void postStart(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {\n        log.info(\"AppListener(postStart)\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void preStop(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {\n        log.info(\"AppListener(preStop)\");\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\n\nTo complete this change, the `pom.xml` file may need to be updated to include the `jakarta.inject` dependency. The exact dependency version may vary depending on the project's requirements and the version of Jakarta EE being used.\n\nFor example, the following dependency may need to be added to the `pom.xml` file:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>jakarta.inject</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jakarta.inject-api</artifactId>\n    <version>2.0.0</version>\n</dependency>\n```\nNote that the version number may need to be adjusted depending on the project's requirements.",
