      "content": "## Reasoning\nTo address the issue described, we need to consider the changes required to migrate the `Producers.java` file to Quarkus. \n\nThe issue suggests that we can skip the `@Produces` annotation if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. However, in this case, we are dealing with a field, not a method. \n\nThe suggestion to use a `@Named` getter method instead implies that we can replace the field with a method that returns the logger instance. This approach is more in line with the Quarkus recommendations.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Remove the `@Produces` annotation from the `log` field.\n2. Create a getter method for the `log` field and annotate it with `@Named`.\n3. Since we are using `@Named`, we need to make sure that the `jakarta.enterprise.context` package is imported.\n\n## Updated File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.utils;\n\nimport jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.inject.Named;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\n/**\n * This class is used to produce loggers for injection.\n */\npublic class Producers {\n\n    @Named\n    @ApplicationScoped\n    public Logger getLogger() {\n        return Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());\n    }\n\n    @Named\n    @ApplicationScoped\n    public Logger produceLog(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {\n        return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nHowever, the above code still uses the `@Produces` annotation for the `produceLog` method. To fully address the issue, we should also consider replacing this method with a `@Named` getter method. Here's an updated version:\n\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.utils;\n\nimport jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.inject.Named;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\n/**\n * This class is used to produce loggers for injection.\n */\npublic class Producers {\n\n    @Named\n    @ApplicationScoped\n    public Logger getLogger() {\n        return Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());\n    }\n\n    @Named\n    @ApplicationScoped\n    public Logger getLogger(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {\n        return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nNote that we've added the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation to the getter methods to define the scope of the logger instances. This is a common scope for logger instances, but you may need to adjust it depending on your specific requirements.\n\nAlso, make sure to update the `pom.xml` file to include the necessary Quarkus dependencies. You may need to add the following dependency:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n    <artifactId>quarkus-logging</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nThis dependency provides the logging functionality for Quarkus.",
