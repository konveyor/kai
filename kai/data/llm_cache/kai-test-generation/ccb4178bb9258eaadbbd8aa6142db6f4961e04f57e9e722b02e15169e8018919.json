      "content": "## Reasoning\nTo address the issue of removing references to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements and replacing them with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents, we need to make the following changes:\n\n1. Remove the import statement for `javax.jms.TextMessage` as it is not used in the provided code snippet.\n2. The `@Incoming` annotation from `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.annotations` is already being used, which is a SmallRye Reactive Messaging annotation and is compatible with Quarkus. Therefore, no changes are required for this annotation.\n\nHowever, we should note that the `@Incoming` annotation is typically used with a `Message` object or a `Payload` object, not a plain `String`. But since the issue is specifically about removing JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements, we will not address this potential issue at this time.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.annotations.Incoming;\nimport javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;\nimport javax.inject.Inject;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\n@ApplicationScoped\npublic class OrderServiceMDB {\n\n    @Inject\n    OrderService orderService;\n\n    @Inject\n    CatalogService catalogService;\n\n    @Incoming(\"orders\")\n    public void onMessage(String message) {\n        System.out.println(\"\\nMessage recd !\");\n        try {\n            Order order = Transformers.jsonToOrder(message);\n            System.out.println(\"Order object is \" + order);\n            orderService.save(order);\n            order.getItemList().forEach(orderItem -> {\n                catalogService.updateInventoryItems(orderItem.getProductId(), orderItem.getQuantity());\n            });\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(e);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nNo additional changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this specific issue. However, it's worth noting that the Quarkus project should have the necessary dependencies for SmallRye Reactive Messaging and other required features. If not already present, the following dependencies might need to be added to the `pom.xml` file:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.smallrye.reactive</groupId>\n    <artifactId>smallrye-reactive-messaging</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n    <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```",
