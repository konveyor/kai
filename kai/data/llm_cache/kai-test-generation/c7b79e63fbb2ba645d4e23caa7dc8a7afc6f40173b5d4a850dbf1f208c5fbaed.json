The issue states that JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary in Quarkus. \n\nHere are the steps to address this issue:\n\n1.  Remove the `@ApplicationPath` annotation from the `RestApplication` class. This annotation is used to specify the root path for the JAX-RS application, but it's not necessary in Quarkus.\n\n2.  Since we're removing the `@ApplicationPath` annotation, we need to update the `pom.xml` file to remove any dependencies related to JAX-RS activation.\n\n3.  We also need to update the imports in the `RestApplication` class to use the Quarkus-specific annotations.\n\n4.  Finally, we need to update the `RestApplication` class to extend the `io.quarkus.runtime.QuarkusApplication` class instead of the `jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application` class.\n\n## Updated File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.rest;\n\nimport io.quarkus.runtime.QuarkusApplication;\nimport io.quarkus.runtime.annotations.QuarkusMain;\n\n/**\n * This class is the main application class for the REST services.\n */\n@QuarkusMain\npublic class RestApplication extends QuarkusApplication {\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nWe need to update the `pom.xml` file to remove the `jakarta.ws.rs` dependency and add the Quarkus BOM (Bill of Materials) to use the Quarkus-specific annotations. Here's an example of the updated `pom.xml` file:\n\n```xml\n<dependencies>\n    <!-- Other dependencies -->\n</dependencies>\n\n<dependencyManagement>\n    <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n            <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n            <artifactId>quarkus-bom</artifactId>\n            <version>2.14.2.Final</version>\n            <type>pom</type>\n            <scope>import</scope>\n        </dependency>\n    </dependencies>\n</dependencyManagement>\n```\n\nNote: Make sure to update the Quarkus version to the latest version available.",
