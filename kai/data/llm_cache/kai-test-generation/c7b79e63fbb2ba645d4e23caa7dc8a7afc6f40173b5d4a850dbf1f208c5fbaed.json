The issue states that JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary in Quarkus, and we can set a root path directly on the application class.\n\nFirst, we need to import the necessary Quarkus annotation, which is `@QuarkusApplication`. This annotation is used to define the root path of the application.\n\nNext, we need to update the `@ApplicationPath` annotation to `@QuarkusApplication` and remove the `ApplicationPath` annotation. The `@QuarkusApplication` annotation will automatically set the root path of the application.\n\nWe also need to update the imports to use the Quarkus annotations and remove the Java EE imports.\n\nFinally, we need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the Quarkus dependencies.\n\n## Updated File\n\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.rest;\n\nimport io.quarkus.runtime.QuarkusApplication;\nimport io.quarkus.runtime.annotations.QuarkusApplication;\n\n/**\n * This class is the main application class for the REST services.\n */\n@QuarkusApplication(\"/services\")\npublic class RestApplication extends QuarkusApplication {\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\n\nWe need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the Quarkus dependencies. We can add the following dependencies to the `pom.xml` file:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n    <artifactId>quarkus-resteasy</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n    <artifactId>quarkus-resteasy-jackson</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nWe also need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the Quarkus plugin:\n\n```xml\n<plugin>\n    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n    <artifactId>quarkus-maven-plugin</artifactId>\n    <version>${quarkus.version}</version>\n    <executions>\n        <execution>\n            <goals>\n                <goal>build</goal>\n                <goal>generate-code</goal>\n                <goal>generate-code-tests</goal>\n                <goal>test</goal>\n                <goal>native</goal>\n            </goals>\n        </execution>\n    </executions>\n</plugin>\n```\n\nNote: The `quarkus.version` property should be replaced with the actual version of Quarkus being used.",
