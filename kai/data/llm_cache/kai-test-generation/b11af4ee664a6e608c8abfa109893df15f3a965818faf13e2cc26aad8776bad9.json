This means we don't need to extend the `Application` class or use the `@ApplicationPath` annotation to configure the root path of our REST application.\n\nHowever, we can still set the root path using the `quarkus.http.root-path` property in the `application.properties` file or using the `@Path` annotation on our REST resources.\n\nIn this case, we can simply remove the `@ApplicationPath` annotation and the `extends Application` clause, as they are not necessary in Quarkus.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.rest;\n\n/**\n * REST Application configuration.\n */\npublic class RestApplication {\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nNote that we don't need to update the `pom.xml` file or imports in this step, as we are only removing unnecessary annotations and class extensions.\n\nHowever, if you want to set a root path for your REST application, you can add the following property to your `application.properties` file:\n```properties\nquarkus.http.root-path=/services\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the `@Path` annotation on your REST resources to specify the root path.
