This is because Jakarta EE 9 and later versions use the `jakarta.annotation` package instead of `javax.annotation` for annotations.\n\nHere are the steps to fix the issue:\n\n1. Identify the import statement that needs to be replaced: `import javax.annotation.Resource;`\n2. Replace the import statement with the equivalent Jakarta EE 9 annotation: `import jakarta.annotation.Resource;`\n3. Verify that the `@Resource` annotation is still valid in the Jakarta EE 9 specification.\n\nNote that this change may have implications for other dependencies in the project, particularly if they rely on the `javax.annotation` package. However, in this specific case, the change only affects the `ShoppingCartOrderProcessor` class.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\nimport jakarta.ejb.Stateless;\nimport jakarta.annotation.Resource;\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\nimport jakarta.jms.JMSContext;\nimport jakarta.jms.Topic;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\n@Stateless\npublic class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n\n    @Inject\n    private transient JMSContext context;\n\n    @Resource(lookup = \"java:/topic/orders\")\n    private Topic ordersTopic;\n\n    \n  \n    public void  process(ShoppingCart cart) {\n        log.info(\"Sending order from processor: \");\n        context.createProducer().send(ordersTopic, Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart));\n    }\n\n\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nIn addition to updating the import statement, we should also verify that the project's dependencies are compatible with Jakarta EE 9. This may involve updating the project's `pom.xml` file to use Jakarta EE 9-compatible dependencies.\n\nSpecifically, we should update the `javaee-api` dependency to use the Jakarta EE 9 API:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-api</artifactId>\n    <version>9.1.0</version>\n    <scope>provided</scope>\n</dependency>\n```\nWe should also verify that any other dependencies, such as the JMS provider, are compatible with Jakarta EE 9.",
