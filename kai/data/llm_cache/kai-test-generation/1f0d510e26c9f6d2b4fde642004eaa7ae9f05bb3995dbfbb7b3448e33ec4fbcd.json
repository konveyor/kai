This is because Quarkus uses a different approach to enable CDI (Context and Dependency Injection) features.\n\nIn Quarkus, CDI is enabled by default, and the `beans.xml` file is not required. The Quarkus guide recommends removing this file to avoid confusion.\n\nTo fix this issue, we can simply remove the `beans.xml` file from the application.\n\n## Updated File\n```xml\n<!-- This file can be removed as it is not required in Quarkus -->\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nNo additional changes are required in the `pom.xml` file or imports. The `beans.xml` file can be safely removed from the application.\n\nNote: If you are using any specific CDI features that are not enabled by default in Quarkus, you may need to configure them explicitly in your application. However, based on the provided information, it appears that this file can be removed without any issues.",
