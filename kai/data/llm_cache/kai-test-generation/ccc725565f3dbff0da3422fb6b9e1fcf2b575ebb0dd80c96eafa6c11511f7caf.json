The `javax` prefix is being replaced with `jakarta` as per the Jakarta EE specification.\n\nFirst, we need to update the `persistence.xml` file to use the `jakarta` prefix for the properties. This involves replacing `javax.persistence.schema-generation.database.action` with `jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.database.action`.\n\nNext, we need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the necessary dependencies for Quarkus. Since we are migrating to Quarkus, we will need to include the Quarkus BOM (Bill of Materials) and the necessary dependencies for Jakarta Persistence.\n\nHowever, since the input file is a persistence.xml file, we do not need to update the pom.xml file in this step. We will need to update the pom.xml file in a subsequent step.\n\n## Updated File\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<persistence version=\"3.0\"\n             xmlns=\"https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n             xsi:schemaLocation=\"\n        https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence\n        https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_3_0.xsd\">\n    <persistence-unit name=\"primary\">\n        <jta-data-source>java:jboss/datasources/CoolstoreDS</jta-data-source>\n        <properties>\n            <property name=\"jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.database.action\" value=\"none\"/>\n            <property name=\"hibernate.show_sql\" value=\"false\" />\n            <property name=\"hibernate.format_sql\" value=\"true\" />\n            <property name=\"hibernate.use_sql_comments\" value=\"true\" />\n            <property name=\"hibernate.jdbc.use_get_generated_keys\" value=\"false\" />\n        </properties>\n    </persistence-unit>\n</persistence>\n```\n\n## Additional Information\n\nIn a subsequent step, we will need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the necessary dependencies for Quarkus and Jakarta Persistence.
