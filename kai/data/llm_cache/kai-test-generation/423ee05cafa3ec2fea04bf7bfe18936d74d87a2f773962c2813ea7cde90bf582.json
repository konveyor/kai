Update the namespace URL: We need to replace `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` with `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee` in the `xmlns` attribute of the `beans` element.\n\n2.  Update the schema location: We need to replace the old schema location with the new one, which is `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee` instead of `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee`.\n\n3.  Update the schema version number: We need to change the schema version number from `beans_1_1.xsd` to `beans_2_0.xsd` to match the new namespace URL.\n\n## Updated File\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!--\n    JBoss, Home of Professional Open Source\n    Copyright 2015, Red Hat, Inc. and/or its affiliates, and individual\n    contributors by the @authors tag.

However, it's worth noting that the `beans.xml` file is a marker file that indicates CDI (Context and Dependency Injection) should be enabled. This file is used by the Java EE container to enable CDI in the application. In Quarkus, CDI is enabled by default, so this file is not strictly necessary. Nevertheless, it's a good practice to include it to ensure that CDI is enabled in the application.",
