      "content": "## Reasoning\nTo address the issue of replacing the namespace and schema version number, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  Update the namespace from `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` to `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee`. This is because Jakarta EE has replaced Java EE, and the namespace has been updated accordingly.\n\n2.  Update the schema version number from `beans_1_1.xsd` to `beans_2_0.xsd`. This is because the latest version of the Jakarta EE beans schema is 2.0.\n\n3.  Update the `bean-discovery-mode` attribute from `all` to `annotated`. This is because Quarkus uses the `@Bean` annotation to enable CDI, and the default discovery mode is `annotated`.\n\n4.  Update the `beans.xml` file to include the `jakarta.xml.bind` dependency in the `pom.xml` file. This is because the `beans.xml` file uses the Jakarta XML Binding (JAXB) annotations, which are part of the `jakarta.xml.bind` dependency.\n\n## Updated File\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!--\n    JBoss, Home of Professional Open Source\n    Copyright 2015, Red Hat, Inc. and/or its affiliates, and individual\n    contributors by the @authors tag.

Here is an example of how to do this:\n\n```xml\n<dependencies>\n    <!-- ... -->\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>jakarta.xml.bind</groupId>\n        <artifactId>jakarta.xml.bind-api</artifactId>\n        <version>4.0.0</version>\n    </dependency>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.glassfish.jaxb</groupId>\n        <artifactId>jaxb-runtime</artifactId>\n        <version>4.0.0</version>\n    </dependency>\n    <!-- ... -->\n</dependencies>\n```\n\nNote that you may need to adjust the versions of the dependencies to match the versions used in your project.",
