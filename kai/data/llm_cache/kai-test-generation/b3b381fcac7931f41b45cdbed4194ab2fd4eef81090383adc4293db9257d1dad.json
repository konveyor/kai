This is because Jakarta EE 9 and later versions use the `jakarta` namespace instead of `javax`. \n\nHere are the steps to fix the issue:\n\n1. Identify the import statement that needs to be replaced. In this case, it's `import javax.enterprise.context.Dependent;` and `import javax.enterprise.inject.Produces;`.\n2. Replace `javax.enterprise` with `jakarta.enterprise` in the import statements.\n3. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are updated in the `pom.xml` file to reflect the change from `javax` to `jakarta`. This may involve updating the Jakarta EE API dependency to version 9 or later.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.persistence;\n\nimport jakarta.enterprise.context.Dependent;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces;\nimport jakarta.persistence.EntityManager;\nimport jakarta.persistence.PersistenceContext;\n\n@Dependent\npublic class Resources {\n\n    @PersistenceContext\n    private EntityManager em;\n\n    @Produces\n    public EntityManager getEntityManager() {\n        return em;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nTo complete this change, the `pom.xml` file should be updated to include the Jakarta EE API dependency with version 9 or later. For example:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-api</artifactId>\n    <version>9.1.0</version>\n    <scope>provided</scope>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nNote: The exact version of the Jakarta EE API dependency may vary depending on the specific requirements of your project.",
