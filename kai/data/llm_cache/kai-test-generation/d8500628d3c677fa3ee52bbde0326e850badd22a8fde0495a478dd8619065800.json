This is because the `javax.inject` package is part of the Java EE specification, and we are migrating to Jakarta EE, which has a different package namespace.\n\nHere are the steps to fix the issue:\n\n1. Replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`.\n2. Update the `@Inject` annotation to use the `jakarta.inject` package.\n\nNo changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this specific issue, as we are only updating the import statement and annotation.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that when migrating to Jakarta EE, you may need to update the dependencies in your `pom.xml` file to use the Jakarta EE APIs instead of the Java EE APIs. But that's a separate issue that will be addressed in subsequent steps.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.utils;\n\nimport weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleEvent;\nimport weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleListener;\n\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\npublic class StartupListener extends ApplicationLifecycleListener {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n    @Override\n    public void postStart(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {\n        log.info(\"AppListener(postStart)\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void preStop(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {\n        log.info(\"AppListener(preStop)\");\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nWhen updating the dependencies in your `pom.xml` file to use Jakarta EE APIs, you may need to replace the `javax.inject` dependency with the `jakarta.inject` dependency. For example:\n```xml\n<!-- Replace this dependency -->\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>javax.inject</groupId>\n    <artifactId>javax.inject</artifactId>\n    <version>1</version>\n</dependency>\n\n<!-- With this dependency -->\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>jakarta.inject</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jakarta.inject-api</artifactId>\n    <version>2.0.0</version>\n</dependency>\n```\nHowever, this is a separate issue that will be addressed in subsequent steps.",
