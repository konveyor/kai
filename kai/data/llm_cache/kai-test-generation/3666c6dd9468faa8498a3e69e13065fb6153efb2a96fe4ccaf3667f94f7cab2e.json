This is because the `@Inject` annotation is being used, and in Jakarta EE, the package for this annotation has been changed from `javax.annotation` to `jakarta.annotation`.\n\nHere are the steps to fix the issue:\n\n1. Replace the import statement `import javax.annotation.Inject;` with `import jakarta.annotation.Inject;`.\n2. No changes are required to the `pom.xml` file as this is just a package rename and the Maven dependency for Jakarta EE already includes the `jakarta.annotation` package.\n3. No other changes are required to the code as the `@Inject` annotation is used in the same way in both `javax.annotation` and `jakarta.annotation` packages.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\nimport javax.ejb.Stateless;\nimport jakarta.annotation.Inject;\nimport javax.jms.JMSContext;\nimport javax.jms.Topic;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\n@Stateless\npublic class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n\n    @Inject\n    private transient JMSContext context;\n\n    @jakarta.annotation.Resource(lookup = \"java:/topic/orders\")\n    private Topic ordersTopic;\n\n    \n  \n    public void  process(ShoppingCart cart) {\n        log.info(\"Sending order from processor: \");\n        context.createProducer().send(ordersTopic, Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart));\n    }\n\n\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNote that we also replaced `@Resource` with `@jakarta.annotation.Resource` to maintain consistency with the package rename.",
