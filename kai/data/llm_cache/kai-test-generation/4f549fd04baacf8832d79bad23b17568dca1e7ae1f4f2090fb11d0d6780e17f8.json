      "content": "## Reasoning\n\n1.  The issue at hand is to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which is a fork of the Java EE API. The Jakarta EE API has its own package namespace, and we need to update the import statement accordingly.\n\n2.  We need to update the import statement in the `ProductService` class. The import statement is located on line 8 of the provided source code.\n\n3.  To update the import statement, we need to replace `javax.inject` with `jakarta.inject`. This will ensure that the correct package is imported for the Jakarta EE API.\n\n4.  We also need to update the pom.xml file to include the necessary dependency for the Jakarta EE API. The dependency should be added to the `dependencies` section of the pom.xml file.\n\n5.  After updating the import statement and the pom.xml file, we need to verify that the updated code compiles successfully.\n\n## Updated File\n\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.CatalogItemEntity;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.Product;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\n\nimport static com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers.toProduct;\n\n@Stateless\npublic class ProductService {\n\n    @Inject\n    CatalogService cm;\n\n    public ProductService() {\n    }\n\n    public List<Product> getProducts() {\n        return cm.getCatalogItems().stream().map(entity -> toProduct(entity)).collect(Collectors.toList());\n    }\n\n    public Product getProductByItemId(String itemId) {\n        CatalogItemEntity entity = cm.getCatalogItemById(itemId);\n        if (entity == null)\n            return null;\n\n        // Return the entity\n        return Transformers.toProduct(entity);\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\n\nTo update the pom.xml file, you need to add the following dependency:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>jakarta.inject</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jakarta.inject-api</artifactId>\n    <scope>provided</scope>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nThis dependency is required for the Jakarta EE API, which is used in the Quarkus framework. The `provided` scope indicates that the dependency is provided by the application server and does not need to be included in the final WAR file.",
