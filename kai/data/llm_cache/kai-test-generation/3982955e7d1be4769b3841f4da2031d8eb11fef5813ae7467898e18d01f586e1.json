This is because Jakarta EE 9 and later versions use the `jakarta.enterprise` package instead of `javax.enterprise` for CDI (Context and Dependency Injection) annotations.\n\nHere are the steps to update the code:\n\n1. Replace the import statement `import javax.enterprise.inject.Produces;` with `import jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces;`\n2. Replace the import statement `import javax.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;` with `import jakarta.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;`\n\nNo changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this specific update, as we are only updating the import statements. However, when migrating to Jakarta EE 9 and later versions, you would typically need to update the dependencies in the `pom.xml` file to use the Jakarta EE 9 and later versions of the APIs.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.utils;\n\nimport jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\n/**\n * This class uses CDI to alias Java EE resources, such as the persistence context, to CDI beans\n *\n */\npublic class Producers {\n\n    Logger log = Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());\n\n    @Produces\n    public Logger produceLog(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {\n        return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nWhen migrating to Jakarta EE 9 and later versions, you would typically need to update the dependencies in the `pom.xml` file to use the Jakarta EE 9 and later versions of the APIs. For example, you would need to update the `javaee-api` dependency to `jakarta.platform:jakarta.jakartaee-api:9.0.0` or later. However, this is not required for this specific update.",
