      "content": "## Reasoning\nTo address the issue of replacing the `javax.jms` import statement with `jakarta.jms`, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify the import statement**: The import statement that needs to be replaced is `import javax.jms.JMSContext;` and `import javax.jms.Topic;`.\n2. **Replace the import statement**: We will replace `javax.jms` with `jakarta.jms` in the import statements. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE namespace instead of the Java EE namespace.\n3. **Verify the package**: We need to verify that the package `jakarta.jms` is available in the Quarkus dependencies. If not, we need to add the necessary dependency to the `pom.xml` file.\n4. **Check for other dependencies**: We need to check if there are any other dependencies that need to be updated due to this change.\n\nAfter analyzing the code, we can see that only the import statements need to be updated. No other changes are required in the code.\n\n## Updated File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\nimport jakarta.ejb.Stateless;\nimport jakarta.annotation.Resource;\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\nimport jakarta.jms.JMSContext;\nimport jakarta.jms.Topic;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\n@Stateless\npublic class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n\n    @Inject\n    private transient JMSContext context;\n\n    @Resource(lookup = \"java:/topic/orders\")\n    private Topic ordersTopic;\n\n    \n  \n    public void  process(ShoppingCart cart) {\n        log.info(\"Sending order from processor: \");\n        context.createProducer().send(ordersTopic, Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart));\n    }\n\n\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nTo complete this change, the following dependency needs to be added to the `pom.xml` file:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>jakarta.jms</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jakarta.jms-api</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```\nNote: If you are using a Quarkus extension for messaging, such as `quarkus-artemis-jms`, you may not need to add this dependency explicitly.",
