      "content": "## Reasoning\n\n1.  The issue at hand is the use of the `@Stateful` annotation, which is specific to Java EE EJBs. To migrate this to Quarkus, we need to replace it with a CDI bean-defining annotation that encompasses the appropriate scope.\n2.  The note suggests that stateful EJBs often translate to `@SessionScoped` beans in Quarkus, but the appropriate scope may differ based on the application architecture. We need to review the application's requirements to determine the correct scope.\n3.  As a good practice, it's recommended to keep state external from the service in Quarkus. This implies that we might need to refactor the code to remove any internal state and instead use external storage or services to manage state.\n4.  Since we're only addressing the issue of the `@Stateful` annotation, we'll focus on replacing it with a suitable CDI bean-defining annotation. We'll assume that the correct scope is `@SessionScoped` for now, but this may need to be adjusted based on further analysis.\n5.  To replace the `@Stateful` annotation, we'll use the `@SessionScoped` annotation from the `javax.enterprise.context` package. However, since we're migrating to Quarkus, we'll also need to update the imports and dependencies accordingly.\n6.  We'll also need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the necessary dependencies for Quarkus and CDI.\n\n## Updated File\n\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport java.util.Hashtable;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\nimport javax.enterprise.context.SessionScoped;\nimport javax.enterprise.inject.Inject;\nimport javax.naming.Context;\nimport javax.naming.InitialContext;\nimport javax.naming.NamingException;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.Product;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCartItem;\n\n@SessionScoped\npublic class ShoppingCartService  {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n    @Inject\n    ProductService productServices;\n\n    @Inject\n    PromoService ps;\n\n    @Inject\n    ShoppingCartOrderProcessor shoppingCartOrderProcessor;\n\n    private ShoppingCart cart  = new ShoppingCart(); //Each user can have multiple shopping carts (tabbed browsing)\n\n    // ... (rest of the code remains the same)\n```\n\n## Additional Information\n\n*   We'll need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the necessary dependencies for Quarkus and CDI. This will likely involve adding the following dependencies:\n    *   `io.quarkus:quarkus-undertow`\n    *   `io.quarkus:quarkus-cdi`\n    *   `javax.enterprise:cdi-api`\n*   We may also need to update the imports to use the Quarkus-specific packages and annotations.\n*   As mentioned earlier, we should review the application's requirements to determine the correct scope for the `@SessionScoped` annotation.\n*   We should also refactor the code to remove any internal state and instead use external storage or services to manage state, as recommended by the note.",
