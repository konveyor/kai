This is because Jakarta EE 9 and later versions use the `jakarta` namespace instead of `javax`.\n\nHowever, upon reviewing the provided code, it appears that the import statement for `javax.persistence` is not present. Instead, the code already uses the `jakarta.persistence` import statement. \n\nBut, there is an import statement for `jakarta.persistence.criteria.CriteriaBuilder`, `jakarta.persistence.criteria.CriteriaQuery`, and `jakarta.persistence.criteria.Root` which is correct.\n\nHowever, there is another import statement for `jakarta.persistence.EntityManager` which is correct.\n\nBut, there is no import statement for `javax.persistence` to replace.\n\nHowever, there is an import statement for `jakarta.inject.Inject` which is correct for Jakarta EE 9 and later versions.\n\nSo, no changes are required for this incident.\n\nHowever, I will provide the updated file as it is.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\nimport jakarta.persistence.EntityManager;\nimport jakarta.persistence.criteria.CriteriaBuilder;\nimport jakarta.persistence.criteria.CriteriaQuery;\nimport jakarta.persistence.criteria.Root;\n\npublic class OrderService {\n\n  @Inject\n  private EntityManager em;\n\n  public void save(Order order) {\n    em.persist(order);\n  }\n\n  public List<Order> getOrders() {\n    CriteriaBuilder cb = em.getCriteriaBuilder();\n    CriteriaQuery<Order> criteria = cb.createQuery(Order.class);\n    Root<Order> member = criteria.from(Order.class);\n    criteria.select(member);\n    return em.createQuery(criteria).getResultList();\n  }\n\n  public Order getOrderById(long id) {\n    return em.find(Order.class, id);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNo additional changes are required for this incident.
