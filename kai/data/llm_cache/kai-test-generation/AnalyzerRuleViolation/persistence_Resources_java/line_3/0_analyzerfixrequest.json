This is because Jakarta EE 9 and later versions use the `jakarta` namespace instead of `javax`.\n\nHere are the steps to update the code:\n\n1. Replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`.\n2. Update the `@Dependent` and `@Produces` annotations to use the `jakarta.enterprise` namespace.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.persistence;\n\nimport jakarta.enterprise.context.Dependent;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces;\nimport javax.persistence.EntityManager;\nimport javax.persistence.PersistenceContext;\n\n@Dependent\npublic class Resources {\n\n    @PersistenceContext\n    private EntityManager em;\n\n    @Produces\n    public EntityManager getEntityManager() {\n        return em;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nWhen updating the import statements, we also need to consider the dependencies in the `pom.xml` file. The `jakarta.enterprise` namespace is part of the Jakarta EE API, so we need to ensure that the correct Jakarta EE API dependency is included in the `pom.xml` file.\n\nFor example, if we are using Maven, we can add the following dependency to the `pom.xml` file:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-api</artifactId>\n    <version>9.1.0</version>\n    <scope>provided</scope>\n</dependency>\n```\nNote that the version of the Jakarta EE API dependency may vary depending on the specific version of Jakarta EE that we are targeting.",
