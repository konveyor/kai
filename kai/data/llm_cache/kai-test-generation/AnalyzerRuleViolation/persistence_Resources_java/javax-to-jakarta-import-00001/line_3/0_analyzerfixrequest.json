This is because Jakarta EE 9 and later versions use the `jakarta` namespace instead of `javax`.\n\nHere are the steps to update the code:\n\n1. Identify the import statement that needs to be updated: `import javax.enterprise.context.Dependent;` and `import javax.enterprise.inject.Produces;`\n2. Replace `javax.enterprise` with `jakarta.enterprise` in the import statements.\n3. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are updated in the `pom.xml` file to use the Jakarta EE 9 or later versions.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.persistence;\n\nimport jakarta.enterprise.context.Dependent;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces;\nimport jakarta.persistence.EntityManager;\nimport jakarta.persistence.PersistenceContext;\n\n@Dependent\npublic class Resources {\n\n    @PersistenceContext\n    private EntityManager em;\n\n    @Produces\n    public EntityManager getEntityManager() {\n        return em;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nTo complete this migration, the following dependencies in the `pom.xml` file should be updated to use the Jakarta EE 9 or later versions:\n\n* `jakarta.enterprise:cdi-api`\n* `jakarta.persistence:javax.persistence-api`\n\nAdditionally, the Java EE dependencies should be replaced with their Jakarta EE counterparts.
