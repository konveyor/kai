This change allows Quarkus to properly handle the injection of the `EntityManager` instance.\n\nAlso, ensure that the necessary Quarkus dependencies are included in the `pom.xml` file. If not already present, you may need to add the Quarkus CDI and Hibernate ORM dependencies. However, this is not required for this specific update.",
