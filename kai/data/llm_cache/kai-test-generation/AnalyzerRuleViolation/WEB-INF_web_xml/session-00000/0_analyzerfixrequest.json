      "content": "## Reasoning\nTo address the issue of session replication in a cloud environment, we need to consider the implications of disabling HTTP session clustering and the benefits of using a remote data grid or cache backing service. \n\nIn this case, we will disable HTTP session clustering by removing the `<distributable />` element from the `web.xml` file. This is because the `<distributable />` element enables session replication across nodes in a cluster, which is not suitable for a cloud environment where data in the memory of a running container can be wiped out by a restart.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that disabling HTTP session clustering has implications, such as the loss of session data in case of a node failure. To mitigate this, we should consider re-architecting the application to use a remote data grid or cache backing service, which can provide a more scalable and elastic solution.\n\nNo changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this step, as we are only modifying the `web.xml` file.\n\n## Updated xml File\n```xml\n<!--suppress ServletWithoutMappingInspection -->\n<web-app xmlns=\"http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n         xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd\"\n         version=\"3.0\">\n</web-app>\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nIn the next steps, we should consider re-architecting the application to use a remote data grid or cache backing service, such as Hazelcast or Infinispan, to store session data. This will require additional dependencies in the `pom.xml` file and changes to the Java code to use the chosen caching solution.",
