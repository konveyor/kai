This dependency is required for the `@Stateless` and `@Inject` annotations used in the `ShoppingCartOrderProcessor` class.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to add the `jakarta.annotation-api` dependency to the `pom.xml`. This will provide the necessary annotations for the class to compile.\n\nHowever, since the provided file is a Java class and not the `pom.xml`, we cannot directly add the dependency to the file. Instead, we will update the Java class to reflect the changes that would be made if the dependency was added.\n\nIn this case, no changes are required to the Java class itself, as the annotations are already correctly imported. The necessary change is to the `pom.xml`, which is not provided.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\n// No changes required to the Java class\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\nimport jakarta.ejb.Stateless;\nimport jakarta.annotation.Resource;\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\nimport jakarta.jms.JMSContext;\nimport jakarta.jms.Topic;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\n@Stateless\npublic class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n\n    @Inject\n    private transient JMSContext context;\n\n    @Resource(lookup = \"java:/topic/orders\")\n    private Topic ordersTopic;\n\n    \n  \n    public void  process(ShoppingCart cart) {\n        log.info(\"Sending order from processor: \");\n        context.createProducer().send(ordersTopic, Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart));\n    }\n\n\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nTo complete the fix, the following dependency needs to be added to the `pom.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>jakarta.annotation</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jakarta.annotation-api</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nThis will provide the necessary annotations for the class to compile.",
