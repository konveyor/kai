This is because the `@Inject` annotation is being used, and in Jakarta EE, the correct package for this annotation is `jakarta.annotation`.\n\nHere are the steps to fix the issue:\n\n1. Identify the import statement that needs to be replaced: `import javax.annotation.Inject;`\n2. Replace the import statement with the correct one: `import jakarta.annotation.Inject;`\n3. Verify that the `@Inject` annotation is being used correctly in the code.\n\nNo changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this specific issue, as we are only updating an import statement. However, it's worth noting that when migrating from Java EE to Jakarta EE, the `pom.xml` file may require updates to the dependencies, such as replacing `javax` with `jakarta` in the artifact IDs.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\nimport jakarta.ejb.Stateless;\nimport jakarta.annotation.Inject;\nimport jakarta.jms.JMSContext;\nimport jakarta.jms.Topic;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\n@Stateless\npublic class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n\n    @Inject\n    private transient JMSContext context;\n\n    @jakarta.annotation.Resource(lookup = \"java:/topic/orders\")\n    private Topic ordersTopic;\n\n    \n  \n    public void  process(ShoppingCart cart) {\n        log.info(\"Sending order from processor: \");\n        context.createProducer().send(ordersTopic, Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart));\n    }\n\n\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNote that the `@Resource` annotation should also be updated to use the `jakarta.annotation` package, as shown in the updated code above.
