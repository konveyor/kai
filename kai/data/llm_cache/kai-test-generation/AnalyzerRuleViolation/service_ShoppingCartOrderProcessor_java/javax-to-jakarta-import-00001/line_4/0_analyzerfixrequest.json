This is because the `jakarta.ejb` package is the new namespace for the Jakarta EE specification, which replaces the `javax.ejb` package used in the Java EE specification.\n\nHere are the steps to update the code:\n\n1. Replace the import statement `import javax.ejb.Stateless;` with `import jakarta.ejb.Stateless;`.\n2. Update the `@Stateless` annotation to use the new namespace.\n\nNo changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this specific update, as we are only updating the import statement and annotation. However, when migrating to Jakarta EE, additional dependencies and configuration changes may be required in the `pom.xml` file.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\nimport jakarta.ejb.Stateless;\nimport javax.annotation.Resource;\nimport javax.inject.Inject;\nimport javax.jms.JMSContext;\nimport javax.jms.Topic;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\n@Stateless\npublic class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n\n    @Inject\n    private transient JMSContext context;\n\n    @Resource(lookup = \"java:/topic/orders\")\n    private Topic ordersTopic;\n\n    \n  \n    public void  process(ShoppingCart cart) {\n        log.info(\"Sending order from processor: \");\n        context.createProducer().send(ordersTopic, Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart));\n    }\n\n\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNote that this update is a small step towards migrating the code to Jakarta EE.
