However, upon reviewing the provided code, there is no import statement for `javax.jms`. \n\nIt seems that the issue might be incorrect or the import statement might be missing from the provided code. \n\nHowever, assuming that the import statement is present in the actual code and needs to be replaced, here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the import statement for `javax.jms` in the code.\n2. Replace `javax.jms` with `jakarta.jms` in the import statement.\n\nSince the import statement is not present in the provided code, no changes are required in the code. \n\nHowever, if the import statement is present in the actual code, the updated import statement would be:\n\n```java\nimport jakarta.jms.*;\n```\n\nNo changes are required in the `pom.xml` file or other imports.\n\n## Updated java File\n\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\nimport jakarta.annotation.Inject;\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.Channel;\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.Emitter;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\npublic class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n    @Inject\n    @Channel(\"ordersTopic\")\n    private Emitter<String> ordersTopicEmitter;\n\n    public void  process(ShoppingCart cart) {\n        log.info(\"Sending order from processor: \");\n        ordersTopicEmitter.send(Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\n\nIf the import statement for `javax.jms` is present in the actual code, it should be replaced with `jakarta.jms` to fix the issue. Also, ensure that the `pom.xml` file has the correct dependencies for `jakarta.jms`. If not, add the following dependency:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>jakarta.jms</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jakarta.jms-api</artifactId>\n    <version>3.0.0</version>\n</dependency>\n```",
