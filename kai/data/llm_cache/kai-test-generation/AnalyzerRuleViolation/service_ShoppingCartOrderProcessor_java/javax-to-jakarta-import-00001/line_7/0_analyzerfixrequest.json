This is because Jakarta EE 9 and later versions use the `jakarta` namespace instead of `javax`.\n\nHere are the steps to fix the issue:\n\n1. Replace the `javax.jms` import statement with `jakarta.jms`.\n2. Update the `JMSContext` and `Topic` class imports to use the `jakarta.jms` package.\n3. No changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this specific issue, but it's essential to note that when migrating to Jakarta EE 9 and later versions, the `pom.xml` file may require updates to use the correct Jakarta EE dependencies.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\nimport jakarta.ejb.Stateless;\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject; \nimport jakarta.jms.JMSContext;\nimport jakarta.jms.Topic;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\n@Stateless\npublic class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n\n    @Inject\n    private transient JMSContext context;\n\n    @javax.annotation.Resource(lookup = \"java:/topic/orders\") \n    private Topic ordersTopic;\n\n    \n  \n    public void  process(ShoppingCart cart) {\n        log.info(\"Sending order from processor: \");\n        context.createProducer().send(ordersTopic, Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart));\n    }\n\n\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nWhen migrating to Jakarta EE 9 and later versions, it's crucial to update the `pom.xml` file to use the correct Jakarta EE dependencies. This may involve replacing `javax` dependencies with `jakarta` dependencies. Additionally, some dependencies may require updates to their versions to ensure compatibility with Jakarta EE 9 and later versions.",
