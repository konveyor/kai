This is because the `@Inject` annotation is part of the Jakarta Inject specification, which has been moved from the `javax.inject` package to the `jakarta.inject` package.\n\nHere are the steps to fix the issue:\n\n1. Replace the import statement `import jakarta.annotation.Inject;` with `import jakarta.inject.Inject;`.\n2. No changes are required to the `pom.xml` file as this is just an import statement change.\n3. No additional dependencies need to be added or updated in the `pom.xml` file.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\nimport jakarta.ejb.Stateless;\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject; // Replaced jakarta.annotation with jakarta.inject\nimport jakarta.jms.JMSContext;\nimport jakarta.jms.Topic;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\n@Stateless\npublic class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n\n    @Inject\n    private transient JMSContext context;\n\n    @jakarta.annotation.Resource(lookup = \"java:/topic/orders\") \n    private Topic ordersTopic;\n\n    \n  \n    public void  process(ShoppingCart cart) {\n        log.info(\"Sending order from processor: \");\n        context.createProducer().send(ordersTopic, Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart));\n    }\n\n\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNote that the `jakarta.annotation.Resource` annotation is still being used, which may need to be updated to `jakarta.annotation.Resource` is not an issue in this case, but it's good to be aware of it for future reference.",
