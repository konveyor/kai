This is because Quarkus uses a different approach for messaging, relying on channels and emitters instead of traditional JMS topics.\n\nHere are the steps to fix the issue:\n\n1. Replace the `@Resource` annotation with `@Inject` and `@Channel` to inject the emitter.\n2. Change the type of the `ordersTopic` field from `Topic` to `Emitter<String>`.\n3. Update the import statements to include the necessary Quarkus dependencies.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\nimport jakarta.annotation.Inject;\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.Channel;\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.Emitter;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\npublic class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n    @Inject\n    private transient JMSContext context;\n\n    @Inject\n    @Channel(\"orders\")\n    private Emitter<String> ordersEmitter;\n\n    public void  process(ShoppingCart cart) {\n        log.info(\"Sending order from processor: \");\n        ordersEmitter.send(Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nTo complete this migration, the following dependencies need to be added to the `pom.xml` file:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n    <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nAdditionally, the `application.properties` file should be updated to configure the channel:\n\n```properties\nmp.messaging.outgoing.orders.connector=smallrye-kafka\nmp.messaging.outgoing.orders.bootstrap.servers=localhost:9092\nmp.messaging.outgoing.orders.topic=orders\n```\n\nNote that the above configuration is for a Kafka connector, and you may need to adjust it according to your specific messaging system.",
