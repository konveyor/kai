The file only contains the root `persistence` element with its attributes.\n\nGiven the information provided, it seems that the issue might be related to the namespace or the schema location. The namespace and schema location are currently pointing to `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence`, which is correct for Jakarta EE. However, the issue might be related to the fact that the `xsi:schemaLocation` attribute is pointing to a schema file with a version number (`persistence_3_0.xsd`).\n\nTo fix this issue, we should verify if there are any properties or elements within the `persistence` element that need to be updated. Since there are no properties or elements provided, we can assume that the issue is not applicable to this specific file.\n\nHowever, to follow the instructions and provide an updated file, we can leave the file as is, since there are no properties prefixed with `javax` to rename.\n\n## Updated xml File\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<persistence version=\"3.0\"\n             xmlns=\"https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence\"\n             xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n             xsi:schemaLocation=\"https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_3_0.xsd\">\n    <!-- Persistence configuration goes here -->\n</persistence>\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNo additional changes are required to the `pom.xml` file or imports, as the issue was not applicable to this specific file.",
