This is because the application is being migrated to Jakarta EE, which has replaced the `javax` namespace with `jakarta`.\n\nIn the given `persistence.xml` file, the property `jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.database.action` already uses the `jakarta` prefix, so it does not need to be changed.\n\nHowever, the properties prefixed with `hibernate` are not directly related to the `javax` to `jakarta` migration. But, we should note that the `hibernate` properties might need to be adjusted in future steps, depending on the specific requirements of the migration.\n\nNo changes are required to the `pom.xml` file or imports in this step, as we are only updating the `persistence.xml` file.\n\n## Updated xml File\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<persistence version=\"3.0\"\n             xmlns=\"https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n             xsi:schemaLocation=\"\n        https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence\n        https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_3_0.xsd\">\n    <persistence-unit name=\"primary\">\n        <jta-data-source>java:jboss/datasources/CoolstoreDS</jta-data-source>\n        <properties>\n            <property name=\"jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.database.action\" value=\"none\"/>\n            <property name=\"hibernate.show_sql\" value=\"false\" />\n            <property name=\"hibernate.format_sql\" value=\"true\" />\n            <property name=\"hibernate.use_sql_comments\" value=\"true\" />\n            <property name=\"hibernate.jdbc.use_get_generated_keys\" value=\"false\" />\n        </properties>\n    </persistence-unit>\n</persistence>\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNo additional changes are required in this step. However, in future steps, we might need to update the `hibernate` properties or add new properties to support the migration to Jakarta EE. Additionally, we should review the `pom.xml` file to ensure that the necessary dependencies are included to support the migration.",
