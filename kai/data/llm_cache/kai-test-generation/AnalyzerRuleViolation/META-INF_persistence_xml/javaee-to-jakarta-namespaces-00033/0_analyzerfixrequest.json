The incidents suggest replacing the `version` attribute value `2.1` with `3.0`, but the file already has the `version` attribute set to `3.0`. \n\nHowever, we can see that the `xsi:schemaLocation` attribute is referencing the `persistence_3_0.xsd` schema, which is correct for Jakarta EE 9 and later versions. But the namespace `xmlns=\"https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence\"` is also correct for Jakarta EE 9 and later versions.\n\nGiven that the file is already correctly configured for Jakarta EE 9 and later versions, no changes are required to address the reported incidents.\n\nHowever, if we were to migrate this file to be compatible with earlier versions of Java EE or Jakarta EE, we would need to update the namespace and schema location accordingly.\n\n## Updated xml File\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<persistence version=\"3.0\"\n             xmlns=\"https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n             xsi:schemaLocation=\"\n        https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence\n        https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_3_0.xsd\">\n    <persistence-unit name=\"primary\">\n        <jta-data-source>java:jboss/datasources/CoolstoreDS</jta-data-source>\n        <properties>\n            <property name=\"jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.database.action\" value=\"none\"/>\n            <property name=\"hibernate.show_sql\" value=\"false\" />\n            <property name=\"hibernate.format_sql\" value=\"true\" />\n            <property name=\"hibernate.use_sql_comments\" value=\"true\" />\n            <property name=\"hibernate.jdbc.use_get_generated_keys\" value=\"false\" />\n        </properties>\n    </persistence-unit>\n</persistence>\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNo additional changes are required to the `pom.xml` file or imports for this step.
