The namespace `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence` needs to be replaced with `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence` to reflect the change from Java EE to Jakarta EE. Additionally, the schema version number needs to be updated to match the new namespace.\n\nThe updated namespace and schema version number are required to ensure compatibility with Jakarta EE and EAP 8. The changes to the namespace and schema version number will not affect the functionality of the persistence configuration, but they are necessary to comply with the new standards.\n\nNo changes are required to the `pom.xml` file or imports at this stage, as the updates are only related to the namespace and schema version number in the `persistence.xml` file.\n\n## Updated xml File\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<persistence version=\"3.1\"\n             xmlns=\"https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence\"\n             xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n             xsi:schemaLocation=\"https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence\n             https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_3_1.xsd\">\n    <!-- Persistence configuration goes here -->\n</persistence>\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNote that the version number in the `persistence` element has been updated to `3.1` to match the new schema version number.
