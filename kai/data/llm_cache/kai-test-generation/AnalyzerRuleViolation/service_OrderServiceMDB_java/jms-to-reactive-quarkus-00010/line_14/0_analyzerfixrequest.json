      "content": "## Reasoning\nThe issue described is related to the migration from Java EE to Quarkus. In Java EE, the `@MessageDriven` annotation is used to define a message-driven bean (MDB), which is a type of enterprise Java bean (EJB). However, Quarkus does not support EJBs and instead uses CDI (Context and Dependency Injection) for bean management.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to replace the `@MessageDriven` annotation with a CDI scope annotation. However, in the provided code, there is no `@MessageDriven` annotation. Instead, we have a class named `OrderServiceConsumer` that seems to be a message consumer, but it's not annotated as an MDB.\n\nGiven the context, it seems that the issue is actually related to the fact that the class is not annotated with a CDI scope annotation, rather than the presence of the `@MessageDriven` annotation.\n\nTo fix this, we can add the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation to the class, which is a CDI scope annotation that indicates the bean should be created once and shared throughout the application.\n\nAdditionally, we need to update the class name to `OrderServiceMDB` as per the file name.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.annotations.Incoming;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\n@ApplicationScoped\npublic class OrderServiceMDB {\n\n    @Inject\n    OrderService orderService;\n\n    @Inject\n    CatalogService catalogService;\n\n    @Incoming(\"orders\")\n    public void onMessage(String orderStr) {\n        System.out.println(\"Received order: \" + orderStr);\n        Order order = Transformers.jsonToOrder(orderStr);\n        System.out.println(\"Order object is \" + order);\n        orderService.save(order);\n        order.getItemList().forEach(orderItem -> {\n            catalogService.updateInventoryItems(orderItem.getProductId(), orderItem.getQuantity());\n        });\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nNo additional changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this specific issue. However, it's worth noting that the `pom.xml` file may need to be updated to include the necessary dependencies for Quarkus and CDI. Additionally, the `jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped` import is used instead of `jakarta.inject.Singleton` or other scopes, as it is the recommended scope for this type of bean in Quarkus.",
