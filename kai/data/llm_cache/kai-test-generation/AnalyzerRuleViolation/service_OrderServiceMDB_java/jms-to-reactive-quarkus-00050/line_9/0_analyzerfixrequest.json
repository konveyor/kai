However, upon reviewing the provided code, there are no direct references to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements. \n\nThe `@Incoming` annotation is from the `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.annotations` package, which is already a SmallRye/Microprofile equivalent. \n\nHowever, considering the context of the issue, it's possible that the `OrderService` or `CatalogService` classes might be using JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements. But without the code for these classes, we can't make any changes.\n\nGiven the provided code, no changes are required to address the mentioned issue.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.annotations.Incoming;\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\npublic class OrderServiceConsumer {\n\n    @Inject\n    OrderService orderService;\n\n    @Inject\n    CatalogService catalogService;\n\n    @Incoming(\"orders\")\n    public void onMessage(String orderStr) {\n        System.out.println(\"Received order: \" + orderStr);\n        Order order = Transformers.jsonToOrder(orderStr);\n        System.out.println(\"Order object is \" + order);\n        orderService.save(order);\n        order.getItemList().forEach(orderItem -> {\n            catalogService.updateInventoryItems(orderItem.getProductId(), orderItem.getQuantity());\n        });\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNo additional changes are required in the `pom.xml` file or imports for this step.
