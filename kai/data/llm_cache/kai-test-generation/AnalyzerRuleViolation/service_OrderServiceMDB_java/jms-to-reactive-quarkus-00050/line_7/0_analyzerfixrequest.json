      "content": "## Reasoning\nTo address the issue of removing references to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements and replacing them with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents, we need to focus on the `@Incoming` annotation.\n\nThe `@Incoming` annotation is part of the SmallRye Reactive Messaging framework, which is already being used in the provided code. However, the issue is likely referring to the fact that the `@Incoming` annotation is being used in conjunction with a JavaEE/JakartaEE application scope (`@ApplicationScoped`).\n\nIn Quarkus, the application scope is still defined by the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation, but it's part of the CDI (Context and Dependency Injection) specification, which is also supported by Quarkus.\n\nHowever, the `@Incoming` annotation is used for reactive messaging, and in this context, it's likely that the issue is referring to the fact that the method `onMessage` is not properly defined as a reactive method.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to make sure that the `onMessage` method is properly defined as a reactive method. We can do this by adding the `@Consume` annotation from the `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging` package, which is the Quarkus equivalent of the `@Incoming` annotation.\n\nHowever, since the `@Incoming` annotation is already being used, we can simply remove the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation, as it's not necessary in this context.\n\nAdditionally, we need to make sure that the necessary dependencies are added to the `pom.xml` file. In this case, we need to add the `smallrye-reactive-messaging` dependency.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.annotations.Incoming;\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\npublic class OrderServiceMDB {\n\n    @Inject\n    OrderService orderService;\n\n    @Inject\n    CatalogService catalogService;\n\n    @Incoming(\"orders\")\n    public void onMessage(String orderStr) {\n        System.out.println(\"Received order: \" + orderStr);\n        Order order = Transformers.jsonToOrder(orderStr);\n        System.out.println(\"Order object is \" + order);\n        orderService.save(order);\n        order.getItemList().forEach(orderItem -> {\n            catalogService.updateInventoryItems(orderItem.getProductId(), orderItem.getQuantity());\n        });\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nTo complete this migration, the following dependency needs to be added to the `pom.xml` file:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.smallrye.reactive</groupId>\n    <artifactId>smallrye-reactive-messaging</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```\nNote that this dependency might already be included in the `pom.xml` file, depending on the project's configuration.",
