      "content": "## Reasoning\nTo address the issue described in incident 0, we need to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This is because the `javax.inject` package is part of the Java EE specification, and when migrating to Jakarta EE, the package names change from `javax` to `jakarta`.\n\nHere are the steps to fix the issue:\n\n1. Replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`.\n2. Update the `@Inject` annotation to use the `jakarta.inject` package.\n\nNo changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this specific issue, as we are only updating the import statement and annotation.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that when migrating to Jakarta EE, you may need to update the dependencies in your `pom.xml` file to use the Jakarta EE APIs instead of the Java EE APIs. But that's a separate issue that will be addressed in subsequent steps.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.utils;\n\nimport weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleEvent;\nimport weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleListener;\n\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\npublic class StartupListener extends ApplicationLifecycleListener {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n    @Override\n    public void postStart(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {\n        log.info(\"AppListener(postStart)\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void preStop(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {\n        log.info(\"AppListener(preStop)\");\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nWhen updating the dependencies in the `pom.xml` file to use Jakarta EE APIs, you may need to replace the `javaee-api` dependency with the `jakarta.platform:jakarta.jakartaee-api` dependency. However, this is not required for this specific issue and will be addressed in subsequent steps.",
