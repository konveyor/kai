These need to be replaced with the Jakarta EE equivalent, which is `jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces` and `jakarta.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint`.\n\nHowever, upon reviewing the provided code, it appears that the import statements are already using the Jakarta EE namespace (`jakarta.enterprise`). Therefore, no changes are required to address the specified issue.\n\nBut, if we were to migrate from Java EE to Jakarta EE, we would need to make sure that the `pom.xml` file is updated to use the Jakarta EE dependencies instead of the Java EE dependencies.\n\nFor example, if the `pom.xml` file contains the following dependency:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>javax.enterprise</groupId>\n    <artifactId>cdi-api</artifactId>\n    <version>2.0</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nIt would need to be updated to:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>jakarta.enterprise</groupId>\n    <artifactId>cdi-api</artifactId>\n    <version>4.0</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nHowever, since the import statements are already correct, no changes are required to the `Producers.java` file.\n\n## Updated java File\n\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.utils;\n\nimport jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\n/**\n * This class is a helper class for producing loggers.\n */\npublic class Producers {\n\n    Logger log = Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());\n\n    @Produces\n    public Logger produceLog(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {\n        return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\n\nNo additional changes are required to the `Producers.java` file. However, the `pom.xml` file may need to be updated to use the Jakarta EE dependencies instead of the Java EE dependencies.",
