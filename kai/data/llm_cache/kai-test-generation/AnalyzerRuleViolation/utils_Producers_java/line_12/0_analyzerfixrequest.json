      "content": "## Reasoning\nTo address the issue, we need to consider the Quarkus way of handling producers. In Quarkus, if a producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier, the `@Produces` annotation can be skipped. \n\nHowever, in this case, the issue is suggesting that the field `log` could be accessed using a `@Named` getter method instead. This implies that we can replace the `@Produces` annotation on the `produceLog` method with a `@Named` annotation on a getter method for the `log` field.\n\nBut, since the `log` field is not being used anywhere in the class and the `produceLog` method is the one that's actually being used to produce the logger, we can simply remove the `log` field and add a `@Named` annotation to the `produceLog` method.\n\nAdditionally, we need to consider the scope of the produced logger. In this case, we can use the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation to indicate that the logger should be created once per application.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.utils;\n\nimport jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.inject.Named;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\n/**\n * This class is a helper class for the application.\n * It provides a producer method for the Logger.\n */\npublic class Producers {\n\n    @ApplicationScoped\n    @Named\n    public Logger produceLog(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {\n        return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nNo additional changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this step. However, it's worth noting that when migrating to Quarkus, you will likely need to add the Quarkus CDI extension to your `pom.xml` file. This can be done by adding the following dependency:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n    <artifactId>quarkus-arc</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```",
