This is because the application is being migrated to Jakarta EE, which uses the `jakarta` namespace instead of `javax`.\n\nHowever, upon reviewing the provided code, it appears that the import statement is already using `jakarta.ws`. Therefore, no changes are required to address incident 0.\n\nBut, considering the migration to Jakarta EE and JWS, we should ensure that the `jakarta.ws.rs` API is being used correctly. In this case, the `@ApplicationPath` annotation is correctly imported from `jakarta.ws.rs`.\n\nNo changes are required to the `pom.xml` file or imports in this step.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.rest;\n\nimport jakarta.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;\nimport jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;\n\n/**\n * REST Application configuration.\n */\n@ApplicationPath(\"/services\")\npublic class RestApplication extends Application {\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNo additional changes are required at this step.
