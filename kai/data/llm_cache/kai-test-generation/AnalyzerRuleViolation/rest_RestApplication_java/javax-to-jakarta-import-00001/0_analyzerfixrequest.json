This is because Jakarta EE has replaced the `javax` namespace with `jakarta` to avoid conflicts with the Java namespace.\n\nHere are the steps to address the issues:\n\n1. Replace the `javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath` import statement with `jakarta.ws.rs.ApplicationPath`.\n2. Replace the `javax.ws.rs.core.Application` import statement with `jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application`.\n\nBy making these changes, we are updating the import statements to use the correct namespace for Jakarta EE.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.rest;\n\nimport jakarta.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;\nimport jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;\n\n/**\n * \n */\n@ApplicationPath(\"/services\")\npublic class RestApplication extends Application {\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nTo complete this migration, the following dependencies in the `pom.xml` file should be updated to use the Jakarta EE namespace:\n\n- `javax.ws.rs-api` should be replaced with `jakarta.ws.rs-api`.\n- `javax.ws.rs.core` should be replaced with `jakarta.ws.rs.core`.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that the project is configured to use the correct Jakarta EE version in the `pom.xml` file. \n\nExample:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>jakarta.ws.rs</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jakarta.ws.rs-api</artifactId>\n    <version>3.0.0</version>\n</dependency>\n```",
