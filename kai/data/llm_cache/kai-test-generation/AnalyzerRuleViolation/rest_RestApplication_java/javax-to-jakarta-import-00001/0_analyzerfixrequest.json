This is because Jakarta EE has replaced the `javax` namespace with `jakarta` to avoid conflicts with the Java EE namespace.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Replace the `javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath` import statement with `jakarta.ws.rs.ApplicationPath`.\n2. Replace the `javax.ws.rs.core.Application` import statement with `jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application`.\n\nBy making these changes, we are updating the code to use the Jakarta EE namespace instead of the Java EE namespace.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.rest;\n\nimport jakarta.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;\nimport jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;\n\n/**\n * Rest Application configuration.\n */\n@ApplicationPath(\"/services\")\npublic class RestApplication extends Application {\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nTo complete the migration, the following additional steps may be required:\n\n* Update the `pom.xml` file to include the Jakarta EE dependencies instead of the Java EE dependencies.\n* Update any other import statements that may be using the `javax` namespace.\n* Verify that the application is working as expected after the migration.\n\nNote: The exact changes to the `pom.xml` file will depend on the specific dependencies and configurations used in the project.",
