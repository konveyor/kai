      "content": "## Reasoning\nThe issue reported is related to JAX-RS activation. In Java EE, JAX-RS activation is typically done by extending the `Application` class from the `javax.ws.rs` package. However, in Quarkus, JAX-RS activation is not necessary. \n\nInstead of extending the `Application` class, we can use the `@ApplicationPath` annotation to set the root path for our REST application. However, as the issue states, this is not necessary and can be omitted.\n\nGiven the provided code, the `RestApplication` class is empty and does not extend the `Application` class. Therefore, no changes are required to address this specific issue.\n\nHowever, to make the class more Quarkus-friendly, we can add the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation to indicate that this class is a CDI bean with application scope.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.rest;\n\nimport javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;\n\n/**\n * REST Application configuration.\n */\n@ApplicationScoped\npublic class RestApplication {\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nNo changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this specific update. However, when migrating to Quarkus, you would typically need to add the Quarkus JAX-RS extension to your `pom.xml` file:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n    <artifactId>quarkus-resteasy</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nAdditionally, you would need to update the `pom.xml` file to use the Quarkus Maven plugin and configure it to build a Quarkus application. But these changes are not necessary for this specific update.",
