This means that the `@ApplicationPath` annotation is not required to set the root path for the REST services. However, we can still use the `@Path` annotation on the application class to set the root path.\n\nSince the `@ApplicationPath` annotation is not necessary, we can remove it. But we still want to keep the root path `/services` for our REST services. We can achieve this by adding the `@Path` annotation on the application class.\n\nWe also need to import the `@Path` annotation from the correct package. In Quarkus, the `@Path` annotation is from the `jakarta.ws.rs` package.\n\nNo changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this step.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.rest;\n\nimport jakarta.ws.rs.Path;\nimport jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;\n\n/**\n * Rest Application configuration.\n */\n@Path(\"/services\")\npublic class RestApplication extends Application {\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNote that in Quarkus, the `@Application` class is not necessary if you don't have any specific configuration to do. You can remove this class altogether if you don't need it. However, this is not the focus of this step, and we will keep the class for now.",
