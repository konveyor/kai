This is because Jakarta EE has its own namespace, which is different from the Java EE namespace.\n\nThe incidents reported are all related to the same issue: replacing the `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` namespace with `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee` and updating the schema version number.\n\nHere are the steps to update the file:\n\n1. Replace `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` with `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee` in the `xmlns` attribute of the `beans` element.\n2. Update the `xsi:schemaLocation` attribute to point to the Jakarta EE schema.\n3.
