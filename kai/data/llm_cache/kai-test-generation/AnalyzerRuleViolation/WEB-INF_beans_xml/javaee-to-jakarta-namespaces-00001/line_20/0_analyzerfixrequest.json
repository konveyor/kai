This is because the file does not contain any relevant configuration or content that would be affected by the namespace and schema version update.\n\n## Updated xml File\n```xml\n<!-- This file has been removed as its content is ignored in Quarkus and not needed for Jakarta EE migration -->\n```\n\nHowever, since the file should be removed, the above content is just a placeholder. In a real-world scenario, you would simply delete the `beans.xml` file.\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNo additional changes are required in the `pom.xml` file or imports, as the file is being removed. If the file contained relevant configuration or content, you would need to update the namespace and schema version, and potentially update dependencies in the `pom.xml` file.",
