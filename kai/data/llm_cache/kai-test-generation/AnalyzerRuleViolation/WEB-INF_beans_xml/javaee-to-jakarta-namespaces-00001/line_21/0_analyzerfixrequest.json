However, based on the description of the issue, we can infer that the file likely contains a namespace declaration with the old Java EE namespace (`http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee`) and a schema version number that needs to be updated.\n\nTo fix this issue, we would typically replace the old namespace with the new Jakarta EE namespace (`https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee`) and update the schema version number to match the target Jakarta EE version.\n\nHowever, since the file should be removed as per the comment, we don't need to apply this fix. Instead, we can simply remove the file or update its content to indicate that it's no longer needed.\n\n## Updated xml File\n```xml\n<!-- This file is no longer needed for Jakarta EE migration and can be removed. -->\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNo additional changes are required in the `pom.xml` file or imports, as the file is being removed or updated to indicate that it's no longer needed.
