However, since the file is not needed for Jakarta EE migration and its content is ignored in Quarkus, the recommended approach is to remove the file altogether.\n\n## Updated xml File\n```xml\n<!-- This file should be removed as its content is ignored in Quarkus and not needed for Jakarta EE migration -->\n```\n\nHowever, since the file should be removed, the above content is just a placeholder.
