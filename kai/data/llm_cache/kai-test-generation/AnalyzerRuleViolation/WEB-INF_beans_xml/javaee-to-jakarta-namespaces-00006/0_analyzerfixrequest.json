The issue is asking to update it to `beans_3_0.xsd` and set the version attribute to `\"3.0\"`. However, the provided file is already using `beans_4_0.xsd`, which is a more recent version than `beans_3_0.xsd`. \n\nSince the task is to migrate to EAP and EAP8 and Jakarta EE and Jakarta EE9+, we should keep the latest version of the schema, which is `beans_4_0.xsd`. But we need to update the `bean-discovery-mode` attribute to a valid value for Jakarta EE 9+, which is not specified in the issue.\n\nHowever, the issue is asking to update the `beans_1_1.xsd` to `beans_3_0.xsd` which is not present in the file. The file is already using `beans_4_0.xsd`. So, we don't need to update the schema version.\n\nBut we need to make sure that the `bean-discovery-mode` attribute is set to a valid value for Jakarta EE 9+. The valid values for `bean-discovery-mode` are `\"all\"`, `\"annotated\"`, and `\"none\"`. The current value `\"all\"` is valid.\n\nNo changes are required in the `pom.xml` file or imports as this is an XML file and does not have any dependencies or imports.\n\n## Updated xml File\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!--\n    JBoss, Home of Professional Open Source\n    Copyright 2015, Red Hat, Inc. and/or its affiliates, and individual\n    contributors by the @authors tag.
