The current XSD version is `beans_1_1.xsd`, but it needs to be updated to `beans_3_0.xsd` and the version attribute should be set to `\"3.0\"`.\n\nHowever, the provided `beans.xml` file already uses `beans_4_0.xsd` which is a higher version than the required `beans_3_0.xsd`. Since the goal is to migrate to EAP and EAP8 and Jakarta-EE and Jakarta-EE9+, we should keep the higher version.\n\nBut, the issue is not present in the provided file, it seems like the issue is outdated or incorrect. If we were to follow the instructions, we would be downgrading the XSD version.\n\nAssuming the issue is incorrect, no changes are required to the `beans.xml` file.\n\n## Updated xml File\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!--\n    JBoss, Home of Professional Open Source\n    Copyright 2015, Red Hat, Inc. and/or its affiliates, and individual\n    contributors by the @authors tag.
