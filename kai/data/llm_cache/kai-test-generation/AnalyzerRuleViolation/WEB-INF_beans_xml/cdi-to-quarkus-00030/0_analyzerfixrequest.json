      "content": "## Reasoning\nThe issue described is related to the `beans.xml` descriptor content being ignored in Quarkus. This file is typically used in Java EE applications to enable CDI (Context and Dependency Injection). However, Quarkus has its own way of handling CDI and the `beans.xml` file is not necessary.\n\nTo address this issue, we can simply remove the `beans.xml` file from the application. This is because Quarkus will automatically enable CDI if it detects the presence of CDI-related annotations in the application code.\n\nNo changes are required to the `pom.xml` file or imports in this step, as we are only removing a file.\n\n## Updated xml File\n```xml\n<!-- This file can be removed as its content is ignored in Quarkus -->\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNote that if you have any specific CDI configurations or settings in the `beans.xml` file, you may need to migrate them to Quarkus-specific configurations. However, based on the provided information, it appears that this file is only being used as a marker to enable CDI, and therefore can be safely removed.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that Quarkus has its own guide for CDI, which can be found in the Quarkus documentation. It's recommended to refer to this guide to understand the supported CDI features in Quarkus and how to configure them.",
