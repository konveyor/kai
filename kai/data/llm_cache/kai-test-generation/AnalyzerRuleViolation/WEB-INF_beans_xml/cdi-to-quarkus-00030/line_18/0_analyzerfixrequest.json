This file is typically used in Java EE applications to enable CDI (Context and Dependency Injection). However, Quarkus has its own way of handling CDI and does not require this file.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to remove the `beans.xml` file from the application. This is because Quarkus ignores the content of this file and it is not necessary for CDI to work.\n\n## Updated xml File\n```xml\n<!-- This file can be removed as its content is ignored in Quarkus -->\n```\n\nHowever, since the file is not needed, it's better to remove it altogether.\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNo additional changes are required in the `pom.xml` file or imports for this specific issue. However, it's worth noting that when migrating to Quarkus, you may need to add the Quarkus CDI extension to your `pom.xml` file to enable CDI features. This can be done by adding the following dependency:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n    <artifactId>quarkus-arc</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nBut this is not required to fix the specific issue described.",
