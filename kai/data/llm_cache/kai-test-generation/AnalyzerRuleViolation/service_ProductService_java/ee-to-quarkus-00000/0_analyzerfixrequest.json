      "content": "## Reasoning\n\nTo migrate the `ProductService.java` file from Jakarta EE to Quarkus, we need to address the issue related to the `@Stateless` annotation. \n\nIn Jakarta EE, `@Stateless` is used to define a stateless session bean, which is a type of Enterprise JavaBean (EJB). However, Quarkus does not support EJBs out of the box. Instead, it relies on CDI (Context and Dependency Injection) for bean management.\n\nTo convert the `ProductService` class to a CDI bean, we need to replace the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope annotation, such as `@ApplicationScoped`. This will make the `ProductService` class a singleton bean that is shared across the application.\n\nAdditionally, we need to ensure that the `CatalogService` class is also a CDI bean, so that it can be injected into the `ProductService` class.\n\nNo changes are required to the `pom.xml` file at this stage, as we are only updating the annotations on the `ProductService` class. However, we will need to ensure that the Quarkus CDI extension is included in the `pom.xml` file, which is typically done by including the `quarkus-arc` dependency.\n\n## Updated java File\n\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.CatalogItemEntity;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.Product;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\nimport jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\n\nimport static com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers.toProduct;\n\n@ApplicationScoped\npublic class ProductService {\n\n    @Inject\n    CatalogService cm;\n\n    public ProductService() {\n    }\n\n    public List<Product> getProducts() {\n        return cm.getCatalogItems().stream().map(entity -> toProduct(entity)).collect(Collectors.toList());\n    }\n\n    public Product getProductByItemId(String itemId) {\n        CatalogItemEntity entity = cm.getCatalogItemById(itemId);\n        if (entity == null)\n            return null;\n\n        // Return the entity\n        return Transformers.toProduct(entity);\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\n\nNote that we have replaced the `@Stateless` annotation with `@ApplicationScoped`, which is a CDI scope annotation. This will make the `ProductService` class a singleton bean that is shared across the application.\n\nAlso, ensure that the `CatalogService` class is also a CDI bean, so that it can be injected into the `ProductService` class.\n\nIn the next step, we will need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the Quarkus CDI extension, which is typically done by including the `quarkus-arc` dependency.",
