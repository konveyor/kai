This is because Jakarta EE 9 and later versions use the `jakarta` namespace instead of `javax`.\n\nHere are the steps to update the code:\n\n1. Identify the import statement that needs to be updated: `import javax.enterprise.context.Dependent;` and `import javax.enterprise.inject.Produces;`\n2. Replace `javax.enterprise` with `jakarta.enterprise` in the import statements.\n3. Verify that the updated import statements are correct and will not cause any compilation errors.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.persistence;\n\nimport jakarta.enterprise.context.Dependent;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces;\nimport javax.persistence.EntityManager;\nimport javax.persistence.PersistenceContext;\n\n@Dependent\npublic class Resources {\n\n    @PersistenceContext\n    private EntityManager em;\n\n    @Produces\n    public EntityManager getEntityManager() {\n        return em;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nWhen updating the import statements, we also need to consider the dependencies in the `pom.xml` file. Since we are migrating to Jakarta EE 9 and later versions, we may need to update the dependencies to use the `jakarta` namespace instead of `javax`.\n\nFor example, we may need to update the `javaee-api` dependency to `jakarta.platform:jakarta.jakartaee-api:9.1.0` or later version.\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-api</artifactId>\n    <version>9.1.0</version>\n    <scope>provided</scope>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nNote: The exact dependency version may vary depending on the specific requirements of the project.",
