      "content": "## Reasoning\nTo migrate the `ShippingService` class from a Java EE `@Stateless` EJB to a Quarkus CDI bean, we need to replace the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope annotation. In this case, we can use the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation, which is a common scope for services that are not request-scoped.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the `@Remote` annotation, which is used to indicate that the EJB can be accessed remotely. In Quarkus, we can use the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation and the `@Singleton` annotation to achieve similar behavior.\n\nWe also need to update the imports to use the Quarkus annotations and to remove the Java EE annotations.\n\n## Updated File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport java.math.BigDecimal;\nimport java.math.RoundingMode;\n\nimport javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;\nimport javax.inject.Singleton;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;\n\n@Singleton\npublic class ShippingService implements ShippingServiceRemote {\n\n    @Override\n    public double calculateShipping(ShoppingCart sc) {\n\n        if (sc != null) {\n\n            if (sc.getCartItemTotal() >= 0 && sc.getCartItemTotal() < 25) {\n\n                return 2.99;\n\n            } else if (sc.getCartItemTotal() >= 25 && sc.getCartItemTotal() < 50) {\n\n                return 4.99;\n\n            } else if (sc.getCartItemTotal() >= 50 && sc.getCartItemTotal() < 75) {\n\n                return 6.99;\n\n            } else if (sc.getCartItemTotal() >= 75 && sc.getCartItemTotal() < 100) {\n\n                return 8.99;\n\n            } else if (sc.getCartItemTotal() >= 100 && sc.getCartItemTotal() < 10000) {\n\n                return 10.99;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        return 0;\n\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public double calculateShippingInsurance(ShoppingCart sc) {\n\n        if (sc != null) {\n\n            if (sc.getCartItemTotal() >= 25 && sc.getCartItemTotal() < 100) {\n\n                return getPercentOfTotal(sc.getCartItemTotal(), 0.02);\n\n            } else if (sc.getCartItemTotal() >= 100 && sc.getCartItemTotal() < 500) {\n\n                return getPercentOfTotal(sc.getCartItemTotal(), 0.015);\n\n            } else if (sc.getCartItemTotal() >= 500 && sc.getCartItemTotal() < 10000) {\n\n                return getPercentOfTotal(sc.getCartItemTotal(), 0.01);\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    private static double getPercentOfTotal(double value, double percentOfTotal) {\n        return BigDecimal.valueOf(value * percentOfTotal)\n                .setScale(2, RoundingMode.HALF_UP)\n                .doubleValue();\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nWe also need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the Quarkus dependencies and to remove the Java EE dependencies.
