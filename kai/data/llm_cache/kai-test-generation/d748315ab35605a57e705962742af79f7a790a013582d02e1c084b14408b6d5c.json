This is because Quarkus uses Jakarta EE, which has replaced the `javax` namespace with `jakarta`.\n\nThe line of code that needs to be updated is:\n```java\nimport javax.persistence.EntityManager;\n```\nIt should be replaced with:\n```java\nimport jakarta.persistence.EntityManager;\n```\nAdditionally, the `@PersistenceContext` annotation also needs to be updated to use the `jakarta.persistence` namespace. The line of code that needs to be updated is:\n```java\nimport javax.persistence.PersistenceContext;\n```\nIt should be replaced with:\n```java\nimport jakarta.persistence.PersistenceContext;\n```\nNo changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this specific update, but it's worth noting that the `jakarta.persistence` dependency should be included in the `pom.xml` file for the project to compile successfully.\n\n## Updated File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.persistence;\n\nimport jakarta.enterprise.context.Dependent;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces;\nimport jakarta.persistence.EntityManager;\nimport jakarta.persistence.PersistenceContext;\n\n@Dependent\npublic class Resources {\n\n    @PersistenceContext\n    private EntityManager em;\n\n    @Produces\n    public EntityManager getEntityManager() {\n        return em;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nMake sure to include the `jakarta.persistence` dependency in the `pom.xml` file. If it's not already included, add the following dependency:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>jakarta.persistence</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jakarta.persistence-api</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```",
