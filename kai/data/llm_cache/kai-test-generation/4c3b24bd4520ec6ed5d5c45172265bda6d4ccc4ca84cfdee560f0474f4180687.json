      "content": "## Reasoning\nTo address the issue described, we need to replace the `@Stateless` annotation with a CDI scope annotation. In this case, we can use `@ApplicationScoped` as it is the most similar to the `@Stateless` annotation in terms of bean lifecycle.\n\nHere are the steps to fix the issue:\n\n1. Remove the `@Stateless` annotation from the `ShoppingCartOrderProcessor` class.\n2. Add the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation to the `ShoppingCartOrderProcessor` class.\n3. Ensure that the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is imported from the correct package.\n\nThe `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is part of the CDI (Context and Dependency Injection) specification, which is included in the Quarkus framework. Therefore, no additional dependencies need to be added to the `pom.xml` file.\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is imported from the correct package. The correct package is `jakarta.enterprise.context`.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;\nimport jakarta.annotation.Inject;\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.Channel;\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.Emitter;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\n@ApplicationScoped\npublic class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n    @Inject\n    private transient JMSContext context;\n\n    @Inject\n    @Channel(\"ordersTopic\")\n    private Emitter<String> ordersTopicEmitter;\n\n    \n  \n    public void  process(ShoppingCart cart) {\n        log.info(\"Sending order from processor: \");\n        ordersTopicEmitter.send(Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart));\n    }\n\n\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNote that this change assumes that the `ShoppingCartOrderProcessor` class is intended to be a singleton, which is the default behavior of `@ApplicationScoped` beans in CDI. If the class is intended to have a different lifecycle, a different scope annotation may be necessary.",
