This is because the `javax.inject` package is part of the Java EE specification, and when migrating to Jakarta EE, the package names have changed from `javax` to `jakarta`.\n\nHere are the steps to fix the issue:\n\n1. Replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`.\n2. Update the `@Inject` annotation to use the `jakarta.inject` package.\n\nNo changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this specific issue, but it's worth noting that when migrating to Jakarta EE, the dependencies in the `pom.xml` file will also need to be updated to use the Jakarta EE APIs.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.utils;\n\nimport weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleEvent;\nimport weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleListener;\n\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\npublic class StartupListener extends ApplicationLifecycleListener {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n    @Override\n    public void postStart(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {\n        log.info(\"AppListener(postStart)\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void preStop(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {\n        log.info(\"AppListener(preStop)\");\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nWhen updating the dependencies in the `pom.xml` file, you will need to replace the Java EE dependencies with the corresponding Jakarta EE dependencies. For example, you may need to replace `javax.inject:javax.inject` with `jakarta.inject:jakarta.inject-api`. The exact dependencies and versions will depend on your specific project requirements.",
