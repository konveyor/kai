This change is required because Quarkus uses JPA 3.0, which has some differences in configuration compared to JPA 2.1.\n\nHere are the steps to update the file:\n\n1. Update the `version` attribute in the root tag from `2.1` to `3.0`. This will ensure that the persistence unit is configured to use JPA 3.0.\n\nNo changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this specific update. However, it's worth noting that when migrating to Quarkus, the `pom.xml` file will likely require significant changes to replace Java EE dependencies with Quarkus dependencies.\n\nNo additional imports are required for this update.\n\n## Updated File\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<persistence version=\"3.0\"\n             xmlns=\"http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n             xsi:schemaLocation=\"\n        http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence\n        http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_3_0.xsd\">\n    <persistence-unit name=\"primary\">\n        <jta-data-source>java:jboss/datasources/CoolstoreDS</jta-data-source>\n        <properties>\n            <property name=\"javax.persistence.schema-generation.database.action\" value=\"none\"/>\n            <property name=\"hibernate.show_sql\" value=\"false\" />\n            <property name=\"hibernate.format_sql\" value=\"true\" />\n            <property name=\"hibernate.use_sql_comments\" value=\"true\" />\n            <property name=\"hibernate.jdbc.use_get_generated_keys\" value=\"false\" />\n        </properties>\n    </persistence-unit>\n</persistence>\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nNote that the `xsi:schemaLocation` attribute has been updated to point to the `persistence_3_0.xsd` schema, which is the correct schema for JPA 3.0.
