      "content": "## Reasoning\nTo address the issue described in incident 0, we need to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This is because the `javax.inject` package is part of the Java EE specification, and Jakarta EE is the new name for Java EE. As a result, the package names have changed from `javax` to `jakarta`.\n\nHere are the steps to fix the issue:\n\n1. Replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`.\n2. Update the `@Inject` annotation to use the `jakarta.inject` package.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.utils;\n\nimport weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleEvent;\nimport weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleListener;\n\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\npublic class StartupListener extends ApplicationLifecycleListener {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n    @Override\n    public void postStart(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {\n        log.info(\"AppListener(postStart)\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void preStop(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {\n        log.info(\"AppListener(preStop)\");\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nNo additional changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this specific change. However, when migrating to Jakarta EE, you may need to update the dependencies in your `pom.xml` file to use the Jakarta EE versions of the APIs. For example, you may need to replace `javax.inject:javax.inject` with `jakarta.inject:jakarta.inject-api`. \n\nAdditionally, if you are using a Java EE server, you may need to update your server to a Jakarta EE-compatible server, such as WildFly or Open Liberty.",
