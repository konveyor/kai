The namespace `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence` should be replaced with `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence` to reflect the change from Java EE to Jakarta EE. Additionally, the schema version number should be updated to match the new namespace.\n\nThe updated namespace and schema version number are required to ensure compatibility with Jakarta EE and Hibernate 6+. The changes will not affect the functionality of the persistence unit, but they are necessary to avoid any potential issues or warnings during the migration process.\n\n## Updated xml File\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<persistence version=\"3.0\"\n             xmlns=\"https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n             xsi:schemaLocation=\"\n        https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence\n        https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_3_0.xsd\">\n    <persistence-unit name=\"primary\">\n        <jta-data-source>java:jboss/datasources/CoolstoreDS</jta-data-source>\n        <properties>\n            <property name=\"javax.persistence.schema-generation.database.action\" value=\"none\"/>\n            <property name=\"hibernate.show_sql\" value=\"false\" />\n            <property name=\"hibernate.format_sql\" value=\"true\" />\n            <property name=\"hibernate.use_sql_comments\" value=\"true\" />\n            <property name=\"hibernate.jdbc.use_get_generated_keys\" value=\"false\" />\n        </properties>\n    </persistence-unit>\n</persistence>\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNo additional changes are required in the pom.xml file or imports for this specific update.
