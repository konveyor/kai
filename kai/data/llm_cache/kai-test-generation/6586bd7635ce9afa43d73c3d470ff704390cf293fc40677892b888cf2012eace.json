This is because Quarkus uses Jakarta EE, which has replaced the `javax` namespace with `jakarta`.\n\nHere are the steps to update the file:\n\n1. Replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence`. This will update the namespace for the persistence annotations.\n2. Verify that the rest of the code remains the same, as the issue only pertains to the import statement.\n\n## Updated File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.model;\n\nimport java.io.Serializable;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\nimport jakarta.persistence.CascadeType;\nimport jakarta.persistence.Column;\nimport jakarta.persistence.Entity;\nimport jakarta.persistence.FetchType;\nimport jakarta.persistence.GeneratedValue;\nimport jakarta.persistence.GenerationType;\nimport jakarta.persistence.Id;\nimport jakarta.persistence.JoinColumn;\nimport jakarta.persistence.OneToMany;\nimport jakarta.persistence.SequenceGenerator;\nimport jakarta.persistence.Table;\n\n@Entity\n@Table(name = \"ORDERS\")\npublic class Order implements Serializable {\n\n    private static final long serialVersionUID = -1L;\n\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY, generator = \"order_seq\")\n    @SequenceGenerator(name = \"order_seq\", sequenceName = \"order_seq\")\n    private long orderId;\n\n    // ... rest of the code remains the same ...\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nWhen updating the import statement, we also need to ensure that the `pom.xml` file is updated to include the correct dependencies for Jakarta EE. Specifically, we need to include the `jakarta.persistence-api` dependency. If it's not already present, add the following dependency to the `pom.xml` file:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>jakarta.persistence</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jakarta.persistence-api</artifactId>\n    <scope>provided</scope>\n</dependency>\n```\nNote that the `scope` is set to `provided`, as the Jakarta EE API is typically provided by the application server or runtime environment.",
