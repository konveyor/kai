This means that the `@ApplicationPath` annotation is not required to set the root path for REST services. However, we can still use the `@Path` annotation on the application class to set the root path.\n\nSince the `@ApplicationPath` annotation is not needed, we can remove it. But we still want to set the root path to \"/services\". We can achieve this by using the `@Path` annotation on the application class.\n\nWe also need to consider the import statements. The `@Path` annotation is part of the JAX-RS API, so we need to import it from the correct package.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.rest;\n\nimport jakarta.ws.rs.Path;\nimport jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;\n\n/**\n * REST Application configuration.\n */\n@Path(\"/services\")\npublic class RestApplication extends Application {\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nNo additional changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this step. However, it's worth noting that when migrating to Quarkus, you will likely need to add the Quarkus JAX-RS extension to your `pom.xml` file. This can be done by adding the following dependency:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n    <artifactId>quarkus-jaxrs</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```\nBut this is not required for this specific step.",
