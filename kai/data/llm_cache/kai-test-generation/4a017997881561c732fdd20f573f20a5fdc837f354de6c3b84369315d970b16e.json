This is because the `@Inject` annotation is now part of the Jakarta EE specification, and its package has been changed from `javax.annotation` to `jakarta.annotation`.\n\nHere are the steps to fix the issue:\n\n1. Replace the import statement `import javax.annotation.Inject;` with `import jakarta.annotation.Inject;`.\n2. No changes are required in the `pom.xml` file as we are only updating the import statement.\n3. No additional dependencies need to be added or updated.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\nimport jakarta.ejb.Stateless;\nimport jakarta.annotation.Inject;\nimport jakarta.jms.JMSContext;\nimport jakarta.jms.Topic;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\n@Stateless\npublic class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n\n    @Inject\n    private transient JMSContext context;\n\n    @jakarta.annotation.Resource(lookup = \"java:/topic/orders\")\n    private Topic ordersTopic;\n\n    \n  \n    public void  process(ShoppingCart cart) {\n        log.info(\"Sending order from processor: \");\n        context.createProducer().send(ordersTopic, Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart));\n    }\n\n\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNote that we also updated the `@Resource` annotation to `@jakarta.annotation.Resource` to maintain consistency with the Jakarta EE specification.",
