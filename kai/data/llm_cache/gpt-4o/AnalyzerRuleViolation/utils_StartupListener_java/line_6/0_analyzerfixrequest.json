      "content": "## Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding the Issue**: The static source code analysis has identified an issue with the import statement for dependency injection. The current import statement uses `javax.inject`, which is part of the older Java EE specifications. As part of migrating to Jakarta EE 9+, we need to update this to use `jakarta.inject`.\n\n2. **Why Change is Needed**: Jakarta EE 9+ has transitioned from the `javax` namespace to the `jakarta` namespace. This change is necessary to align with the new Jakarta EE specifications, which is crucial for compatibility and future-proofing the application.\n\n3. **Impact on Code**: The change involves updating the import statement from `javax.inject.Inject` to `jakarta.inject.Inject`. This is a straightforward change as the functionality and usage of the `Inject` annotation remain the same.\n\n4. **Impact on External Dependencies**: Since this change is related to the namespace, it does not directly impact the `pom.xml` unless there are specific dependencies that need to be updated to support Jakarta EE 9+. However, typically, the Jakarta EE dependencies would be updated as part of a broader migration effort, which might involve updating the `pom.xml` to include Jakarta EE 9+ dependencies.\n\n5. **Updating Imports**: The import statement for `Inject` needs to be updated in the `StartupListener.java` file. This involves changing the line from `import javax.inject.Inject;` to `import jakarta.inject.Inject;`.\n\n6. **Testing the Change**: After making this change, it is important to test the application to ensure that dependency injection works as expected with the new namespace.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.utils;\n\nimport weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleEvent;\nimport weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleListener;\n\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;  // Updated import statement\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\npublic class StartupListener extends ApplicationLifecycleListener {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n    @Override\n    public void postStart(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {\n        log.info(\"AppListener(postStart)\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void preStop(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {\n        log.info(\"AppListener(preStop)\");\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\n\n- **Future Steps**: As part of the migration process, other parts of the codebase will likely need similar updates to transition from `javax` to `jakarta`. Additionally, the `pom.xml` should be reviewed to ensure that it includes the necessary Jakarta EE 9+ dependencies.\n- **Testing**: Ensure that the application is thoroughly tested after making namespace changes to verify that all components function correctly with the new Jakarta EE specifications.",
