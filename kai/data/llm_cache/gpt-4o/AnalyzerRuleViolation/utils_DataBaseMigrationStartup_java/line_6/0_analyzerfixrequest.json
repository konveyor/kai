      "content": "## Reasoning\n\nTo address the issue highlighted in the static source code analysis, we need to replace the `javax.annotation` import statement with `jakarta.annotation`. This change is necessary because the Jakarta EE 9+ platform has transitioned from the `javax` namespace to the `jakarta` namespace. This is a critical step in migrating applications to be compatible with Jakarta EE 9+ and beyond.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of what needs to be done:\n\n1. **Identify the Imports to Change**: \n   - The file currently imports `javax.annotation.PostConstruct` and `javax.annotation.Resource`. Both of these need to be updated to use the `jakarta.annotation` namespace.\n\n2. **Update the Imports**:\n   - Change `import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;` to `import jakarta.annotation.PostConstruct;`.\n   - Change `import javax.annotation.Resource;` to `import jakarta.annotation.Resource;`.\n\n3. **Verify the Changes**:\n   - Ensure that the rest of the code remains unaffected by this change. The annotations `@PostConstruct` and `@Resource` are used in the same way under the `jakarta.annotation` namespace, so no further code changes are necessary.\n\n4. **Consider External Dependencies**:\n   - Since this change is related to the namespace transition, it might require ensuring that the project dependencies (e.g., in `pom.xml`) are compatible with Jakarta EE 9+. However, this specific step does not require immediate changes to the `pom.xml` unless there are version conflicts or missing dependencies.\n\nBy making these changes, we align the code with the Jakarta EE 9+ standards, which is a necessary step for migration.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.utils;\n\nimport org.flywaydb.core.Flyway;\nimport org.flywaydb.core.api.FlywayException;\n\nimport jakarta.annotation.PostConstruct;\nimport jakarta.annotation.Resource;\nimport javax.ejb.Singleton;\nimport javax.ejb.Startup;\nimport javax.ejb.TransactionManagement;\nimport javax.ejb.TransactionManagementType;\nimport javax.inject.Inject;\nimport javax.sql.DataSource;\nimport java.util.logging.Level;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\n/**\n * Created by tqvarnst on 2017-04-04.\n */\n@Singleton\n@Startup\n@TransactionManagement(TransactionManagementType.BEAN)\npublic class DataBaseMigrationStartup {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger logger;\n\n    @Resource(mappedName = \"java:jboss/datasources/CoolstoreDS\")\n    DataSource dataSource;\n\n    @PostConstruct\n    private void startup() {\n\n\n        try {\n            logger.info(\"Initializing/migrating the database using FlyWay\");\n            Flyway flyway = new Flyway();\n            flyway.setDataSource(dataSource);\n            flyway.baseline();\n            // Start the db.migration\n            flyway.migrate();\n        } catch (FlywayException e) {\n            if(logger !=null)\n                logger.log(Level.SEVERE,\"FAILED TO INITIALIZE THE DATABASE: \" + e.getMessage(),e);\n            else\n                System.out.println(\"FAILED TO INITIALIZE THE DATABASE: \" + e.getMessage() + \" and injection of logger doesn't work\");\n\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\n\n- After making these changes, it is advisable to run the application or its tests to ensure that the migration to the `jakarta.annotation` namespace does not introduce any runtime issues.\n- Future steps in the migration process may involve updating other parts of the codebase and ensuring compatibility with Jakarta EE 9+ libraries and application servers.",
