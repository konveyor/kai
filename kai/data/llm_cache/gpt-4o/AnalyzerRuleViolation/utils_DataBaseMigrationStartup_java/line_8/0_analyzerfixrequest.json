      "content": "## Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding the Issue**: The issue highlighted is to replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb`. This is a common requirement when migrating from older Java EE versions to Jakarta EE 9+, as the namespace has changed from `javax` to `jakarta`.\n\n2. **Identifying the Impacted Lines**: In the provided code, the impacted lines are:\n   - `import javax.ejb.Singleton;`\n   - `import javax.ejb.Startup;`\n   - `import javax.ejb.TransactionManagement;`\n   - `import javax.ejb.TransactionManagementType;`\n\n3. **Updating the Imports**: We need to update these import statements to use the `jakarta.ejb` package instead of `javax.ejb`. This involves changing the prefix from `javax` to `jakarta`.\n\n4. **Checking for Other Dependencies**: Since the change is only related to the import statements, there are no other dependencies or code changes required at this step. However, it's important to ensure that the project is using a version of Jakarta EE that supports these changes, which might require updating the dependencies in the `pom.xml` if not already done.\n\n5. **Testing the Change**: After making the changes, the code should be tested to ensure that it compiles and runs correctly with the updated imports. This step is crucial to verify that the migration step has been successful.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.utils;\n\nimport org.flywaydb.core.Flyway;\nimport org.flywaydb.core.api.FlywayException;\n\nimport jakarta.annotation.PostConstruct;\nimport jakarta.annotation.Resource;\nimport jakarta.ejb.Singleton;\nimport jakarta.ejb.Startup;\nimport jakarta.ejb.TransactionManagement;\nimport jakarta.ejb.TransactionManagementType;\nimport javax.inject.Inject;\nimport javax.sql.DataSource;\nimport java.util.logging.Level;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\n/**\n * Created by tqvarnst on 2017-04-04.\n */\n@Singleton\n@Startup\n@TransactionManagement(TransactionManagementType.BEAN)\npublic class DataBaseMigrationStartup {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger logger;\n\n    @Resource(mappedName = \"java:jboss/datasources/CoolstoreDS\")\n    DataSource dataSource;\n\n    @PostConstruct\n    private void startup() {\n\n\n        try {\n            logger.info(\"Initializing/migrating the database using FlyWay\");\n            Flyway flyway = new Flyway();\n            flyway.setDataSource(dataSource);\n            flyway.baseline();\n            // Start the db.migration\n            flyway.migrate();\n        } catch (FlywayException e) {\n            if(logger !=null)\n                logger.log(Level.SEVERE,\"FAILED TO INITIALIZE THE DATABASE: \" + e.getMessage(),e);\n            else\n                System.out.println(\"FAILED TO INITIALIZE THE DATABASE: \" + e.getMessage() + \" and injection of logger doesn't work\");\n\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\n\n- **pom.xml Considerations**: Ensure that the `pom.xml` is configured to use Jakarta EE 9+ dependencies. This might involve updating the version of the Jakarta EE API dependency to a version that supports the `jakarta.ejb` package.\n- **Testing**: After making these changes, it's important to run the application to ensure that everything works as expected with the new imports. This includes checking for any runtime issues that might arise due to the namespace change.",
