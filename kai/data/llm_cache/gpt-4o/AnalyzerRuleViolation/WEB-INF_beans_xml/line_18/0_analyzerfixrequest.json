      "content": "## Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding the Issue**: The issue at hand is to update the XML namespace and schema location in the `beans.xml` file to align with the Jakarta EE specifications. This is a common step when migrating from Java EE to Jakarta EE, as the namespace URLs have changed.\n\n2. **Namespace Update**: The current namespace `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` is specific to Java EE. For Jakarta EE, this needs to be updated to `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee`. This change reflects the transition from Java EE to Jakarta EE, which is now under the Eclipse Foundation.\n\n3. **Schema Version Update**: The schema version in the `beans.xml` file is currently `beans_1_1.xsd`, which corresponds to Java EE 7. For Jakarta EE 9+, the schema version should be updated to `beans_3_0.xsd`. This update ensures compatibility with the latest Jakarta EE specifications.\n\n4. **Impact on External Dependencies**: This change in the `beans.xml` file does not directly impact the `pom.xml` or any Java imports, as it is a configuration file for CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection). However, it is crucial to ensure that the project dependencies in the `pom.xml` are compatible with Jakarta EE 9+.\n\n5. **Implementation**: The changes will be made directly in the `beans.xml` file by updating the namespace and schema location.\n\n## Updated xml File\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!--\n    JBoss, Home of Professional Open Source\n    Copyright 2015, Red Hat, Inc. and/or its affiliates, and individual\n    contributors by the @authors tag.
