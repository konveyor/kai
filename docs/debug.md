# Debug Kai And File Issues

## Helpful logs

Under your working directory at `/.vscode/konveyor`:

- `analysis_<>.json` is an analysis output file that gives details on the rules used during analysis.

Use `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the command palette and search for: `Developer: Open Extension Logs Folder` with logs at `konveyor.konveyor/`

- `analyzer.log`: This file is useful for debugging issues related to running analysis. It provides details about the Java and Maven installation, the initialization of the Java connection, and the startup process of the analyzer server.

- `extension.log`: This log is intended for debugging the RPC server and solution server, and any communication with the AI system. It captures interactions involved in fixing incidents and retrieving results.
