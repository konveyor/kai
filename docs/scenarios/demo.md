# Kai Demo

Konveyor AI (kai) is Konveyor's approach to easing modernization of application source code to a new target by leveraging LLMs with guidance from static code analysis augmented with data in Konveyor that helps to learn how an Organization solved a similar problem in the past (Source: https://github.com/konveyor-ecosystem/kai/blob/main/README.md)

In this demo, we will showcase the capabilities of Konveyor AI (Kai) in facilitating the modernization of application source code to a new target. We will illustrate how Kai can handle various levels of migration complexity, ranging from simple import swaps to more involved changes such as modifying scope from CDI bean requirements. Additionally, we will look into migration scenarios that involves EJB Remote and Message Driven Bean(MBD) changes

We will focus on migrating a partially migrated [JavaEE Coolstore application](https://github.com/konveyor-ecosystem/coolstore.git) to Quarkus, a task that involves not only technical translation but also considerations for deployment to Kubernetes. By the end of this demo, you will understand how Konveyor AI (Kai) can assist and expedite the modernization process.

## Pre-req

- Podman
- VSCode
- Git
- Kubernetes cluster (minikube)
- GenAI credentials
- mvn
- Quarkus 3.10
- Java 17

## Step 1: Setup

In this step, we will configure the Kai IDE plugin within VSCode to showcase the capabilities of Kai. For this demo, we will be using the model `meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct` within the Kai configuration. This setup ensures that the demo runs seamlessly within the VSCode environment, highlighting the efficiency and power of Kai for code migration in the context of our specific scenario.

### Setup Kai VSCode IDE plugin

- Follow along the steps listed in [here](https://github.com/konveyor-ecosystem/kai-vscode-plugin/blob/main/docs/user-guide.md) to integrate Kai IDE plugin with VSCode.

- Before starting the Kai server, Select model `meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct` by uncommenting the following block in `kai/config.toml` file

````yaml
# **IBM served codellama**
# ```
 [models]
   provider = "ChatIBMGenAI"

   [models.args]
      model_id = "meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct"
      parameters.max_new_tokens = 2048
# ```
````

Make sure to comment the default provider, as there can be only one model provider enabled at any given time.

```yaml
[models]
provider = "ChatIBMGenAI"

[models.args]
model_id = "mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v01"
```

If you are interested in using `gpt-3.5-turbo` refer to the section below,

#### Running Kai with GPT-3.5

- Export your OpenAI api key `export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your-openai-api-key>"`

- Before starting the Kai server, Select model `gpt-3.5-turbo` by uncommenting the following block in `kai/config.toml` file

````yaml
# **OpenAI GPT 3.5**
# ```
 [models]
   provider = "ChatOpenAI"

   [models.args]
   model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
# ```
````

- Run the server using `make run-server`

#### Run Kai with demo mode

If you don't have access to GEN_AI key, you can run the server in demo mode which will use cached responses

To run the Kai server in demo mode,
`GENAI_KEY="dummyvalue" KAI__DEMO_MODE=true make run-server`

## Step 2: Demo

In this demo, we will explore Kai's capabilities through practical examples within the Coolstore application.

### 2.1 Clone the coolstore app

Let's clone the Coolstore application, which we will be used demo the migration process to Quarkus.

1. To clone the Coolstore demo from its repository -

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/konveyor-ecosystem/coolstore.git
   ```

2. Next, switch to the branch of the Coolstore app that's been partially migrated -

   ```bash
   git checkout partial-migration
   ```

### 2.2 Run Analysis

We will analyze the Coolstore application using the following migration targets to identify potential areas for improvement:

- containerization
- jakarta-ee
- jakarta-ee8+
- jakarata-ee9+
- quarkus

1. Open VSCode and load coolstore project if it is not already loaded.
2. Follow steps from 1 through 4 from https://github.com/konveyor-ecosystem/kai/tree/main/ide#usage-summary
3. Once the analysis is complete you will see incidents listed on the following files

- `src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/model/ShoppingCart.java`
- `src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/model/InventoryEntity.java`
- `src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service/CatalogService.java`
- `src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service/ShippingService.java`
- `src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service/ShoppingCartOrderProcessor.java`

_*Note*: While the file `src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/rest/RestApplication.java ` is flagged, for the purpose of this demo it is okay to skip that file and proceed._

The incidents in the above files will provide insights into potential issues or areas that require attention during the migration process.

#### 2.2.1 Change import namespaces

- Right-click on the file `src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/model/ShoppingCart.java`.
- Select Kai Fix-All.
- Accept the proposed changes.
- Repeat the same process for the file - `src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/model/InventoryEntity.java`.

![Change import namespaces](model.png)

Th above steps show how Kai simplifies the translation of import namespaces, ensuring seamless automated migration of javax libraries to jakarta persistence libraries.

#### 2.2.2 Modify Scope from CDI bean requirements

In this step, we will use Kai to modify the scope in `CatalogService.java` to adhere to Quarkus CDI bean requirements. Kai will handle this automatically, ensuring seamless migration.

- Right-click on the file `src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service/CatalogService.java`.
- Select Kai Fix-All.
- Accept the proposed changes.

#### 2.2.3 EJB Remote and Message Driven Bean(MDB) changes

We will address EJB Remote and MDB functionalities in `ShippingService.java` and `ShoppingCartOrderProcessor.java` respectively. Kai will guide us through replacing EJBs with REST functionality and updating related imports and annotations.

##### EJB Remote

- Right-click on the file `src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service/ShippingService.java`.
- Select `Kai Fix-All`.
- Accept the proposed changes.

![EJB Remote - Before/After](ejb_remote.png)

Due to the absence of support for Remote EJBs in Quarkus, you will notice that these functionalities are removed and replaced with REST functionality.

##### Message Driven Bean(MDB)

- Right-click on the file `src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service/ShoppingCartOrderProcessor.java`.

- Select `Kai Fix-All` and accept the changes.

![MDB - before/after](mdb.png)

- Note the changes made to `ordersEmitter` channel:

  ```java
  @Inject
  @Channel("orders")
  Emitter<String> ordersEmitter;
  ```

  Although this change is valid, it's important to note that the LLM is unaware of the number of consumers for `orders` channel. It assumed that there is a single consumer for `orders`, but, this app has multiple consumers of `orders`. Assuming there's only a single consumer can lead to `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.providers.wiring.TooManyDownstreamCandidatesException`. To avoid this, add the `@Broadcast` annotation:

  ```java
  import io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.annotations.Broadcast;

  @Inject
  @Channel("orders")
  @Broadcast
  Emitter<String> ordersEmitter;
  ```

- Since the LLM doesn't have access to the project's `pom.xml` file, it lacks information about available dependencies. Update the import statements to the following:

  ```java
  import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Channel;
  import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Emitter;
  ```

![MDB - Manual updates](mdbchanges.png)

### 2.3 Deploy app to Kubernetes

Although the app is deployable to any [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) distribution.
For the sake of simplicity we choose [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/).

> Prerequisite: It is assumed that minikube is installed. If not you can follow the instructions [here](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).

The coolstore requires a PostgreSQL database. To install Postgres into minikube, we have added deploy scripts. run the scripts in the following order

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/persistent-volume.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/persistent-volume-claim.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/postgresql-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/postgresql-service.yaml
```

This should setup the database ready for connections from the coolstore app.

To deploy the app, simply run the following command, it will create a docker image on the local drive and load the manifests into kubernetes to pull the image.

```mvn
mvn clean compile package -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true
```

- Once deployed, access the app via browser hitting the localhost and port.
