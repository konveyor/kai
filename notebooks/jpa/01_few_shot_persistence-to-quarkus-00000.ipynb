    "# Few Shot: JPA - Rule: persistence-to-quarkus\n",
    "\n",
    "> This notebook will work with a LLM to generate a fix for JPA related persistence rules found in 'cmt' and 'bmt'.  We will use 'bmt' as the solved example.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sample Applications Used\n",
    "* 2 sample apps from [JBoss EAP Quickstarts](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/tree/7.4.x) were chosen: cmt & bmt. \n",
    "* Christopher May [christophermay07](https://github.com/christophermay07) migrated these applications to Quarkus in https://github.com/christophermay07/quarkus-migrations.  \n",
    "* We have created new repositories that contain the original Java EE state in the 'main' branch and Chris' Quarkus migration in the 'quarkus' branch \n",
    "    * [bmt](https://github.com/konveyor-ecosystem/bmt)\n",
    "    * [cmt](https://github.com/konveyor-ecosystem/cmt)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Using Custom Rules for JPA\n",
    "* Rules were developed by Juanma [@jmle](https://github.com/jmle)\n",
    "    * Rules originally from: https://github.com/jmle/kai-examples/blob/main/analyzer-lsp-rules/01-persistence-to-quarkus.windup.yaml\n",
    "    * Specific rule this notebook will fix: `persistence-to-quarkus-00000`\n",
    "            The persistence API of JavaEE provides all sorts of utilities for accessing databases in an object oriented manner (object-relational mapping and such). It is 100% supported, but still needs to be migrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "            The Persistence API in JavaEE has the concept of datasources and persistence units. These are abstractions of the underlying databases for ORM purposes, and they need to be configured. In JavaEE, XML files are used for this, but in Quarkus all this configuration can (and should) be moved to a single, centralized *.properties file.\n",
    "\n",
    "            This rule simply looks for the existence of the XML configuration rules.\n",
    "    * persistence-to-quarkus-00011\n",
    "            This is a rule to remove an unneeded (and illegal) `@Produces` annotation on the `@EntityManager`. We want to to see if the LLM will suggest to add the Qualifier, as explained in the message.\n",
