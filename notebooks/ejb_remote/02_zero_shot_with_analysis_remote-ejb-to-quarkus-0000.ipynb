An endpoint must be added to the annotation in place of `<endpoint>` to specify the actual path to the REST service.\\n 2. Remove `@Stateless` annotations if present. Given that REST services are stateless by nature, it makes it unnecessary.\\n 3. For every public method on the EJB being converted, do the following:\\n - Annotate the method with `@jakarta.ws.rs.GET`\\n - Annotate the method with `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path(\"<endpoint>\")` and give it a proper endpoint path. As a rule of thumb, the method name can be used as endpoint, for instance:\\n ```\\n @Path(\"/increment\")\\n public void increment() \\n ```\\n - Add `@jakarta.ws.rs.QueryParam(\"<param-name>\")` to any method parameters if needed, where `<param-name>` is a name for the parameter.', 'codeSnip': '  1  /*\\n  2   * JBoss, Home of Professional Open Source\\n  3   * Copyright 2015, Red Hat, Inc. and/or its affiliates, and individual\\n  4   * contributors by the @authors tag.
