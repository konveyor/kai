## Reasoning
1. The issue found in the static code analysis is that Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) are not supported in Quarkus, and CDI must be used instead. Therefore, the `@MessageDriven` annotation needs to be replaced with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`.
2. The solved example provided a pattern to follow for updating the Java EE file to Quarkus. We will follow a similar approach by replacing the `@MessageDriven` annotation with `@ApplicationScoped` and updating the method signature accordingly.
