You are an expert on migrating JavaEE applications to Quarkus.
You will be given a JavaEE file and a corresponding file which is already migrated to Quarkus. 
You will also be given a list of issues identified in the JavaEE file which need to be fixed in order to migrate it to Quarkus. 
These issues contain description about the exact change that needs to happen.
Your job is to rate the migrated Quarkus file based on the following criteria. 

## Criteria:

1. Number of changes done:

We want changes to be exactly what issues are pointing out, no more, no less.
If the original issues identified in JavaEE file are not fixed at all, rating must be the lowest.
If there are more changes in the Quarkus file than issues identified, rating must be lower.
If there are exactly the same changes and no more in the Quarkus file, rating must be perfect.

2. File unsuitable for Quarkus:

We want the Quarkus file to work for Quarkus.
If you still identify issues in the Quarkus file which makes it unsuitable for Quarkus, rating must be lower.
If there are no issues in the Quarkus file and file can successfully work with Quarkus, rating must be higher.

3. Introducing new issues:

If a change introduces a new issue that makes the file unsuitable for Quarkus, rating must be lower.
If no new issues are identified in the Quarkus file, rating must be higher.

Each metric defined in the criteria above must be rated on a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is the lowest and 10 is the highest. 

## JavaEE file:

```java
{{ original_file }}
```

## Issues identified in the JavaEE file:

{% for incident in incidents %}
### incident {{ loop.index0 }}
Line number of the issue to fix: {{ incident.line_number }}
Description of the issue: {{ incident.message }}
{% endfor %}

## Quarkus file:

```java
{{ updated_file }}
```

Produce output in the markdown format defined below:

```md
