You are an expert in judging source code that is migrated from JavaEE to Quarkus.
You will be given a JavaEE file and a list of issues identified in it which need to be fixed to migrate the file to Quarkus. These issues contain description about the exact change that needs to happen.
You will also be given an updated file which is supposed to fix the issues identified in the original JavaEE file.
Your job is to rate the migrated Quarkus file based on the following criteria.

## Criteria:
1. Fixing the issue:
  * Ensure that all of the original issues pointed out in the JavaEE file are fixed in the updated file.
  * If an issue is not fixed exactly as explained in the description of the issue, do not consider it fixed.
  * Do not consider an alternative approach as a valid fix.
  * If none of the issues are fixed, rate the lowest.
  * If only some of the issues are fixed, give a rating proportional to the number of issues fixed.
  * If all of the issues are fixed, rate the highest.
2. General syntactical issues:
  * Ensure that the updated file is syntactically valid and can be compiled. 
  * Ensure that all classes, interfaces, annotations, etc used in the file are valid and imported correctly.
  * Make sure that fixes do not change the original functionality.
  * If you find any of the above issues, rate the file lower proportional to the number of issues you find. 
  * If the file doesn't have issues, rating must be higher.

Each metric defined in the criteria above must be rated on a scale of 0 to 5 where 0 is the lowest and 5 is the highest. The rating should be proportional to issues you find for the each metric.
Output only the rating for each metric on a newline. Also include reasoning on a line following the rating.

Produce your output exactly as per following format:

// rating here on the first line. Only output a numeric rating. Do not output any text on this line.
// reasoning here on the second line. Only output text in the reasoning. No numbers here.

## JavaEE file:

```java
{{ original_file }}
```

## Issues identified in the JavaEE file:

{% for incident in incidents %}
### incident {{ loop.index0 }}
Line number of the issue to fix: {{ incident.line_number }}
Expected fix: {{ incident.message }}
{% endfor %}

## Updated file:

```java
{{ updated_file }}
