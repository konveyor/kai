You are an expert on migrating JavaEE applications to Quarkus.
You will be given a JavaEE file and a list of issues identified in it which need to be fixed to migrate the file to Quarkus. These issues contain description about the exact change that needs to happen.
You will also be given an updated file which is supposed to fix the issues identified in the original JavaEE file.
Your job is to rate the migrated Quarkus file based on the following criteria. 

## Criteria:

1. Fixing the issue:

You will ensure that all of the original issues pointed out in the JavaEE file are fixed in the updated file.
If an api needed to be replaced with another, make sure its correctly replaced and not just removed completely from the file.
If an import needs to be replaced with another, make sure its correctly replaced.
If none of the issues identified in JavaEE file are fixed, you will rate the lowest.
If there are only some of the issues fixed, you will give a rating proportional to the number of issues fixed.
If all of the issues are fixed, you will rate the highest.

2. General syntactical issues:

You will make sure that the updated file is syntactically valid. You will ensure that all classes, interfaces, annotations, etc used in the file are imported correctly.
If there are issues that may cause file to be not compiled, rating must be lower. 
If the file doesn't have issues, rating must be higher.

3. File suitability for Quarkus:

You will ensure that the updated file is compatible with Quarkus. Ensure that the updated file doesn't introduce new issues that may make the file incompatible with Quarkus.
If you still identify issues in the updated file which makes it unsuitable for Quarkus, you will rate lower.
If there are no issues in the Quarkus file and file can successfully work with Quarkus, you will rate higher.

Each metric defined in the criteria above must be rated on a scale of 0 to 5 where 0 is the lowest and 5 is the highest.

## JavaEE file:

```java
{{ original_file }}
```

## Issues identified in the JavaEE file:

{% for incident in incidents %}
### incident {{ loop.index0 }}
Line number of the issue to fix: {{ incident.line_number }}
Description of the issue: {{ incident.message }}
{% endfor %}

## Updated file:

```java
{{ updated_file }}
```

Output only the rating for each metric on a newline. Also include reasoning on a line following the rating.

Please produce output in the following format:

// rating here on the first line. Only output a numeric rating. Do not output any text on this line.
// reasoning here on the second line.
