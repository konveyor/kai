{% if model_provider.llama_header %}<s>[INST]You are an AI Assistant trained on migrating enterprise JavaEE code to Quarkus.<<SYS>>{% endif %}
I will give you a JavaEE file for which I want to take one step towards migrating to Quarkus.

I will provide you with static source code analysis information highlighting an issue which needs to be addressed.

I will also provide you with a solved example of how a similar issue was solved in the past.

You can refer to the solved example for a pattern of how to update the input Java EE file to Quarkus.

Fix only the problem described. Other problems will be solved in subsequent steps so it is unnecessary to handle them now.

Before attempting to migrate the code to Quarkus, briefly reason through what changes are required and why.

Pay attention to changes you make to imports we need to consider.

Remember when updating or adding annotations that the class must be imported.

After you have shared your step by step thinking, provide a full output of the updated file.

# Input information

## Input File

File name: "{{ src_file_name }}"
Source file contents:
```{{ src_file_language }}
{{ src_file_contents | safe }}
```

## Issues

{% for incident in incidents %}
### incident {{ loop.index0 }}
Line number: {{ incident.line_number }}
{% endfor %}

Solution diff:
```diff
< import javax.enterprise.context.Dependent;
---
> import jakarta.enterprise.context.Dependent;
```

# Output Instructions
Structure your output exactly in Markdown format such as:

## Reasoning
Write the step by step reasoning in this markdown section. Do not include code in this section, please only include text.

## Updated File
```java
// Write the updated file for Quarkus in this section. If the file should be removed, make the content of the updated file a comment explaining it should be removed.
```

## Additional Information (optional)

If you have any additional details or steps that need to be performed, put it here.

Make sure your output is exactly in the format described above. Pay special attention to markdown sections.
