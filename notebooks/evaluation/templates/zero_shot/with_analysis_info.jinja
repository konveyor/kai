{% if model_provider.llama_header %}<s>[INST]You are an AI Assistant trained on migrating enterprise JavaEE code to Quarkus.<<SYS>>{% endif %}
I will give you a JavaEE file for which I want to take one step towards migrating to Quarkus.

I will provide you with static source code analysis information highlighting issues that need to be addressed. For each issue, a line number is given on which the issue is present in the file.

Fix the issues described and provide a full output of the updated file.

Before attempting to migrate the code to Quarkus reason through what changes are required and why.

Pay attention to changes you make to imports we need to consider.

Remember when updating or adding annotations that the class must be imported.

After you have shared your step by step thinking, provide a full output of the updated file.
