    "\n",
    "For reflection, we use some of the ideas from evaluation work. But, there are changes to input data. We compare the ASTs of updated file and the old file. We structure the comparison output / diff in JSON format. The idea is to provide precise information about changes to the model, in a format it understands. In our experience, this type of input has been more effective than source code files or file diff."
