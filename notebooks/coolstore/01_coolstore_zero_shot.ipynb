    "This notebook will work with LLM to provide fixes for issues identified in [Coolstore](https://github.com/konveyor-ecosystem/coolstore) app for different kind of incidents. In this experiment, we use zero shot approach. The incidents have varying levels of complexity for the fixes. For each incident, we try to evaluate the responses under two conditions - with and without supplemental information from the analysis. We do at least 3 experiments with a prompt before concluding.\n",

    "#### Llama 70b\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike 13b, 70b is performing way better when additional analysis information is provided. It does seem to understand nuances of updating the annotations as well as imports. It seems that its taking into consideration its own Quarkus knowledge as well as incident messages. It does strike a good balance between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "````md\n",
    "To address the incidents, we need to make the following changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Replace `javax.ejb` with `jakarta.ejb` (incidents 0 and 1): We need to update the import statements to use the Jakarta EE namespace instead of the Java EE namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Replace `javax.inject` with `jakarta.inject` (incident 2): Similar to the previous step, we need to update the import statement to use the Jakarta EE namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Replace `javax.jms` with `jakarta.jms` (incidents 3-6 and 11-14): We need to update the import statements to use the Jakarta EE namespace. However, we also need to consider that Quarkus uses SmallRye Reactive Messaging instead of JMS. We will need to remove the JMS-related imports and replace them with the corresponding SmallRye Reactive Messaging imports.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Replace `@MessageDriven` with `@ApplicationScoped` (incident 7): Since EJBs are not supported in Quarkus, we need to replace the `@MessageDriven` annotation with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Migrate `destinationLookup` property (incidents 8-10): We need to annotate the `onMessage` method with the `@Incoming` annotation from `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging` to indicate the name of the queue.\n",

However, it is hallucinating on imports and importing things that don't exist. 70b on the other hand, does a comparable job on annotations. However, misses the imports altogether. One key insight is that, without supplemental information, none of the two models are good enough to get expected output.\n",
