Kai [(/ka…™/, rhymes with pie)](https://www.howtopronounce.com/ka%C3%AC-4) - An
AI-enabled tool that simplifies the process of modernizing application source
code to a new platform. It uses **Large Language Models** (LLMs) guided by
**static code analysis**, along with **data from Konveyor**. This data provides
insights into how the organization solved similar problems in the past, helping
**streamline** and **automate** the code modernization process.

## üîç About The Project

Kai is an AI-enabled tool that assists with modernizing applications. Kai is
designed to help developers write code more efficiently by providing suggestions
and solutions to common problems. It does this by performing [Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401), working with LLMs
by using [Konveyor](https://github.com/konveyor) analysis reports about the
codebase and generating solutions based on previously solved examples.

Now, you may be thinking: _How is Kai different than other generative AI tools?_

### 1. Kai uses Konveyor‚Äôs analysis reports

Konveyor generates analysis reports via
[Kantra](https://github.com/konveyor/kantra) throughout a migration. This
history of reports tells you what‚Äôs wrong with your codebase, where the issues
are, and when they happened. This functionality exists today, and developers are
already using this data to make decisions. And because of our RAG approach, this
is all possible _without additional fine-tuning_.

### 2. Kai learns throughout a migration

As you migrate more pieces of your
codebase with Kai, it can learn from the data available, and get better
recommendations for the next application, and the next, and so on. This shapes
the code suggestions to be similar to how your organization has solved problems
in the past.

### 3. Kai is focused on migration

LLMs are very powerful tools, but without explicit guidance, they can generate a
lot of garbage. Using Konveyor‚Äôs analysis reports allows us to focus Kai‚Äôs
generative power on the specific problems that need to be solved. This pointed,
specific data is the key to unlocking the full potential of large language
models.

## üöÄ Getting Started

We recommend new users download a [release of Kai](https://github.com/konveyor/editor-extensions/releases) and then walk through a guided scenario to get a feel of Kai's potential.
We've streamlined the install experience so you just need to download a `.vsix` file and install it in your VSCode IDE.

1. Please follow the steps here to proceed with getting started: [docs/getting_started.md](docs/getting_started.md)
2. After you have Kai installed we encourage you to run through one of our guided scenarios at: [docs/scenarios](docs/scenarios/README.md)
