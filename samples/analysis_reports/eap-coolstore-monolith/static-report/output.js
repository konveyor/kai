configured properly.\n * Disable HTTP session clustering and accept its implications.\n * Re-architect the application so that sessions are stored in a cache backing service or a remote data grid.\n\n A remote data grid has the following benefits:\n\n * The application is more scaleable and elastic.\n * The application can survive EAP node failures because a JVM failure does not cause session data
