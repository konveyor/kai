  message:
    "\n The configuration parameters of SMTP services for outbound mail may
    contain environment-specific values such as static IP addresses, host names, properties,
    credentials, or certificates.\n\n Recommendations\n\n * In a cloud environment,
    mail systems should be considered backing services and treated like attached resources.\n
    * Ensure that the configuration of the underlying outbound mail connection is
    not environment-specific.\n * In OpenShift Container Platform, store configuration
    parameters as environment variables or in a ConfigMap.\n "
