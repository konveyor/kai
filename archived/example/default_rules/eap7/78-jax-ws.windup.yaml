  message:
    "\n \n EAP 7 uses JAX-WS 2.2 style constructors with the `javax.xml.ws.WebServiceFeature`
    class to build clients that are injected into web service references (i.e. using
    the `@WebServiceRef` annotation). \n This means that user provided service classes
    injected by the container must implement JAX-WS 2.2 or later. \n The class must
    be changed to add the constructor [`Service(URL wsdlDocumentLocation, QName serviceName,
    WebServiceFeature... features)`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/xml/ws/Service.html#Service&#40;java.net.URL,%20javax.xml.namespace.QName,%20javax.xml.ws.WebServiceFeature...&#41;)\n
