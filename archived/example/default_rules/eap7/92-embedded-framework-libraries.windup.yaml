    \                       While official support for Seam 2.2 applications was dropped
    in JBoss EAP 6, it was still possible to configure dependencies for JSF 1.2 and

    now includes JSF 2.2 and Hibernate 5, does not support Seam 2.2 or Seam 2.3 due
    to end of life of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit. It is recommended that you
    rewrite your Seam components using CDI beans.\n                        In the
