  message:
    "\n The application contains an embedded resource adapter descriptor ('ra.xml'),
    which implements the Java Connector Architecture (JCA) for certain Enterprise
    Information Systems (EIS).\n\n JCA often uses tightly coupled interactions between
    the connector and the application. Tight coupling is not suitable in a cloud environment
    because of scalability problems.\n\n Recommendation: Review the purpose of the
    resource adapter to determine whether it is required in a cloud environment.\n "
