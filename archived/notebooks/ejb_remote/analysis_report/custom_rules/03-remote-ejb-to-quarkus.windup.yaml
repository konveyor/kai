  message: |-
    Remote EJBs are not supported in Quarkus, and therefore its use must be removed and replaced with REST functionality. In order to do this:
     1. Replace the `@Remote` annotation on the class with a `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path("<endpoint>")` annotation. An endpoint must be added to the annotation in place of `<endpoint>` to specify the actual path to the REST service.
     2. Remove `@Stateless` annotations if present. Given that REST services are stateless by nature, it makes it unnecessary.
     3. For every public method on the EJB being converted, do the following:
     - Annotate the method with `@jakarta.ws.rs.GET`
     - Annotate the method with `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path("<endpoint>")` and give it a proper endpoint path. As a rule of thumb, the method name can be used as endpoint, for instance:
     ```
     @Path("/increment")
     public void increment() {{ ... }}
     ```
     - Add `@jakarta.ws.rs.QueryParam("<param-name>")` to any method parameters if needed, where `<param-name>` is a name for the parameter.
