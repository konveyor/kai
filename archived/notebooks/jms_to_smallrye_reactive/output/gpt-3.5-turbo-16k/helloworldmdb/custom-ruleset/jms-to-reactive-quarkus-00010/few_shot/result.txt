## Reasoning
1. The issue found from static code analysis is that the `@MessageDriven` annotation is not supported in Quarkus and needs to be replaced with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`.
2. Looking at the solved example, we can see that the `@MessageDriven` annotation was replaced with `@ApplicationScoped`.
3. We need to update the import statements to use the correct annotations for Quarkus. The import statements for `@MessageDriven`, `@ActivationConfigProperty`, `@Message`, `@MessageListener`, and `@TextMessage` should be replaced with the corresponding imports for Quarkus.
4. We need to update the method signature of the `onMessage` method to match the Quarkus equivalent. In the solved example, the method signature was changed to accept a `String` parameter instead of a `Message` parameter.
